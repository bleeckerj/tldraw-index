    "summary": "A review I wrote of Incorporations (Zone Books, 1992) back while in the masters program in the Engineering School at the University of Washington, Seattle and figuring out my voice in the whole..postmodern aesthetics + critical theory (or whatever..) idiom.  The volume is a pretty awesome multidisciplinary anthology exploring the intersections of technology, culture, and humanity at the close of the twentieth century. Edited by Jonathan Crary and Sanford Kwinter, the book examines how advancements in biotechnology, surveillance, and artificial intelligence have reshaped the body and societal consciousness.  Includes contributions from fields such as philosophy, architecture, and science, essays by Judith Barry, J.G. Ballard, and Donna Haraway critique the commodification of life and the evolving relationship between humans and technology. Incorporations challenges readers to reflect on modernity’s impact and the cultural frameworks shaping the future.",

    "summary": "Pussy Weevil — a \"proto-Tex-Avery\" animated character with a malleable and virtually indestructible form. A vile, reactive persona that mutates, spits, and glitches. Exhibited at Bitforms Gallery May 15–June 19, 2003, and Ars Electronica 2003.\n\nPussy Weevil is an individual software animated character that responds to the viewer’s distance or proximity. The piece involves choreography in space and deals with subject / object relationships vis-a-vis the viewer. Pussy Weevil ignores you, outrageously derides you, tries to scare you but it runs away in fright if you get too close.\n \nPussy Weevil questions how digital characters can be affected by interactions in analog spaces and examines the relationship between the real and computer made worlds.\n",

Time to collaborate with specialists so we can all navigate into more habitable futures together!\n\nA decade and a half of identical headlines warning that “the university as we know it” is over tells you everything about the misalignment between specialized institutions and the futures they’re supposed to deliver.\n\nThe failure of the university is a microcosm of the failure of any large, siloed organization. Over-specialization creates blind spots. Those blind spots make the organization brittle, unable to adapt, and ultimately unable to articulate a preferred future.\nThe role of the generalist is to re-stitch the connective tissue the structure no longer allows.\n",

    "summary": "Organizations often ask people with a generalist, orienting sensibility to behave like delivery specialists — and then interpret the resulting friction as a personal or performance problem.\nThe essay that went out in the email newsletter last week (and appeared as well on the other various endpoints like Substack, Patreon, and LinkedIn) generated a good amount of reader mail. The questions were less about the theme of “misalignment” and more about the undergirding principles of the specialists and the generalist, and how their various approaches, ways of working, deliverables and — overall — ontologies can be distinguised and the consequences of these differences to organizations.\nNow, I recognize that these are somewhat broad schematic categories and that in practice, people are more complex and nuanced than these labels suggest. Still, I think there is value in clarifying the differences in order to better understand how they can collaborate effectively.\nSome of this comes from the confusion I had several years ago when I was asked to lead a team that is composed of very creative individuals, but who had been so thoroughly shaped by the incolcated to the operationally-oriented mindset of the larger organization within which they worked that they struggled to meet their new objectives, which were much more (very) near-term delivery oriented. I had proposed a reorientation of their remit as well as their KPIs, but I had to first clarify for myself what the differences were between these two mindsets and approaches to work. This reorientation was seen as too radical — and I felt that leading a delivery team was not the right fit for me, so I declined (after over half a year of conversations so, oh well..)\n",

All of this reframes marketing as care, context, and community rather than chasing metrics. It's got examples, anecdotes, and contributions from other creators (me too!), it argues for defining your own version of success, protecting your creative joy, and staying devoted to the long-term practice of making. It seems to still exist as a living/evolving Google doc.\n\nWhen I was promoting The Manual of Design Fiction, I found myself reflecting on the challenges creative people face when it comes to promoting their work. This was particularly acute when my co-authors simply could not do that kind of work. Creatives love to create (obs) and love making things but (strangely) dread the promotional side of things. This guide is Metalabel's attempt to distill what they've learned about promoting creative work in a way that feels authentic and sustainable.\n\nProduced by Metalabel, this guide is for anyone looking to promote their creative work without losing their soul. It’s a call to embrace authenticity, build meaningful connections, and find joy in the act of creation itself.\n",

The anti-aesthetic then was about resisting spectacle and surface; today it might be about reclaiming the interval of thinking and intention that generation threatens to erase. Of course, I'm not referring to all generative AI art here, but rather the kind that is produced and consumed unthinkingly, as a kind of visual fast food — all the anime, the portraits, the endless style transfers, the goof-ball “slop”, and so on that floods social media feeds, and that risks numbing our capacity to see and think critically about images.\n",

Still optimizing what used to work.\n\nHere’s the shift I'm talking about:\n \nImagination isn’t a luxury — it’s operational strategy.\n\nPrototyping as the primary mode of futures design — exploring actively, materially rather than just thinking about it or writing another framework about it. Or, even worse perhaps — another book about it.\n\nTime to go kinetic. Building. Making. Prototyping.\n\nOntological furniture crafting. Making the future tangible to where you are actually making the future you will inhabit.\n\nIn a time of rapid change, your team’s ability to speculate with intent in a hands-on way is what keeps innovation alive.\n\nOrganizations that invest in disciplined imagination aren’t just ready for the next shift — they’re already inventing it.\n\nIn this series of posts, I’ll share how to embed speculative design functions inside your team — to prototype future products, anticipate emerging markets, and navigate uncertainty with conviction. All of this drawin from my on-the-ground experiences working on innovation teams, the work I do here for clients — and my time building, growing, and eventually selling my product company OMATA, a cycling computer that was decidedly speculative and shaped by imagination.\n",

The simple beautify of translating feeling and ideas into images is a powerful way to see the world differently, to make sense of complexity, and to envision new possibilities.\nDave is a long-time friend and collaboratory. We met many years ago when he was running XPLANE, a pioneering visual thinking and visual storytelling company. He invited me to this retreat he was hosting called “The Overlap” at Asilomar Conference Center in Pacific Grove, California. It was a small gathering of about 25 or so people from various disciplines and backgrounds, all interested in design and creativity. I was the only person there who worked in technology and futures design — and probably at that time had never really been to a hands-on workshop quite like that. It was eye-opening and inspiring.\n",

These notes underscore the importance of this relationship in the creative process and the challenges faced by artists in communicating their vision.

His questions were not just about facts but about possibilities. We talked about how futures thinking isn’t just forecasting; it’s about expanding our imagination—seeing worlds that don’t yet exist. When young people like Vikram participate actively in envisioning the future, they bring fresh energy and new ideas that challenge the status quo. It’s a reminder - the future belongs to those who dare to imagine it. \n\nWe often view youth as passive consumers of information, but they are potent creators of possibility. Engaging them means more than teaching; it’s about empowering them to lead. \n\nVikram’s energy to blog is a testament to that spirit. Supporting young voices isn’t an option. Rather, it’s a necessity for a more habitable, innovative world. \n\nAre we listening enough to the next generation’s dreams and visions?\n",

To find the ways to innovate and create value in this new landscape, we must be willing to take risks and learn from our failures — and even redefine what ‘failure’ might mean.\n\nWhat I've developed through my own practice is to look at AI as a collaboratory. A kind of co-creator or muse. I develop tools — like experiments that may or may not feel like they came from the future — that allow me to experiment with new forms of collaboration and co-creation. It's like making my own little science-fictional tools and to experiment with what AI might be like when it is a collaborator rather than something that deprives me of the kind of creativity that is uniquely and satisfyingly human.\n",

    "summary": "How does one describe those things that will become obvious in hindsight, but do not make sense in the present? The value of imagining alternatives to the present is that it helps us see the value in things that are so obvious that we don't see them. I've beenn thinking about this notion, and I wish there was a word for it. It's the ‘wheels on luggage’ effect — the ‘what took them so long..’ wondering.\nJogging wasn't a thing until, by force of commitment and fortitude, Bill Bowerman writes a book explaining it to a widespread audience.\nThe Fosbury Flop was a dramatic rethinking of the high jump that was so obvious in hindsight, but not at the time. Perhaps it was even scandalous, or I like to imagine it was. ‘Dude..don't do it!’\nI often bring this logic to the studies, experiments, and futures wonderings that I do here at Near Future Laboratory. Trying to find a kernel of something by going to the near future that responds to what notion we are missing in the present. Like with A.I. doing the work for us — some of it is great to have it do. But focussing for a moment on writing, I was wondering about the value of writing as a craft, as a thing that is not just about getting words on a page, but about the care and attention to the craft of writing itself.\n\nThis is a reflection on Tom Renner's inevitabilism post and the value of imagining alternatives to the present. How does one describe those things that will become obvious in hindsight, but do not make sense in the present? The value of imagining alternatives to the present is that it helps us see the value in things that are so obvious that we don't see them.\nThis motivates the soft gooey center of the speculative design fiction project Vibewriter, which anticipates a future where the value of writing is not in speed, but in the care and attention to the craft of writing.\n",

I was the product designer, the industrial designer, the software designer, the interaction designer, the UX designer, the filmer, the brand guy, the service & support guy, the marketing guy, the advertising guy, shipping & receiving dept., the UI designer, the design researcher, the design strategist, and the design thinker.\nAnd to bookend this experience, I finally printed this book — two volumes! — that is as much a scrapbook created along the way as it is a tangible record of doing something that took a lot out of me and put more than that back into me.\nAlso somewhat of a template for how I might represent the range of capabilities I could bring to a future organization, a new team, a new studio, or a new lab.\nPlus, I can assuredly call myself a product designer and industrial designer, if that ever mattered — and not just a hardware designer, or a software designer, or an interaction designer, or a UX designer, or a UI designer, or a design researcher, or a design strategist, or a design thinker. I suppose this is to prove the point that it's not what you say you are, or what degree you got from where. What matters in the end is what you have done.\n",

    "summary": "I read with interest the article in The New Yorker by Hua Hsu, \"What Happens After A.I. Destroys College Writing?\". What was most sort of..disconcerting, I suppose about the article was how flippant the students were as regards their disdain for the process of writing, and how they were using AI to generate their essays, papers, and other assignments. It was as if they were just going through the motions of college, but not really engaging with the material or the process of learning.\nBut, maybe this is their moment to define the world they will enter after college. Maybe they are just being practical, and using the tools available to them to get through the system. I don't know. But it got me thinking about the designed functional fiction projects I've been working on — particularly Ghostwriter and Vibewriter, both of which are studies, observations and reflections on what writing might become in some habitable AI future in which writing is not just done by AI, but done in collaboration with AI.\nMore like a \"Centaur\" model of writing, where the human and the AI are working together to produce something that is more than either could do alone, but the human is running or guiding the creative flow, allowing for the muse/AI to provide inspiration, prompts, and even some of the writing itself..but not all of it.\n",

Writing Be More Than a Gimmick?\" by Anna Wiener, which explores the implications of A.I. in writing and creativity.\nReflecting on the question of A.I. and writing, I wanted to create a software artifact(s) that experimented with the idea of A.I. as a muse rather than a tool that would do the writing for me.\nI think A.I. can be a useful partner in the creative process, not taking over the writing, but acting like a mellow muse. The alternative to thinkig of writing as drudgery in the case of creative expression is to think of it more like a coach or perhaps a lowkey collaborative partner.\nOne of these software experiments/prototypes is the Vibewriter project, which is a speculative design fiction that serves as an exercise tool for writers to bulk up their brain muscles for creative writing and explore how a generative A.I. muse can be a useful partner in the creative process.\nWhen considering the role of A.I. in writing, it's essential to ask: can it truly enhance the creative process, or is it merely a tool for convenience?\nI suppose this is a bit of the motivation for the Vibewriter project, which is a speculative design fiction that is meant to be an exericse tool for writers both to get bulk up their brain muscles for creative writing and, also I suppose, to see how a generative A.I. muse can be a useful partner in the creative process.\n",

After years turning speculative ideas into real products, I’m drawn to the challenge of bringing that practice inside an organization—building and leading a creative technology team that can navigate uncertainty, prototype meaning, and translate cultural insight into action. As AI and culture evolve faster than process, we need teams that explore before they execute.\n\nDeveloping the experience to move from speculation to shipping is crucial. Most companies have R&D for technology, but few have R&D for culture.\n\nIt’s time to change that. By embedding a small, hands-on team focused on Cultural R&D within an organization, we can make imagination a core competency and better navigate the uncertainties of the future.\n\nWhat I've learned is how to do this. With my company OMATA I took a speculative idea and made it real. Turning imagination into something tangible, real, and that shipped (and may still again!)\n\nAre you interested in figuring out how to build such a team inside your organization? I'm open to conversations about how we can make this happen. Let's talk.\n",

    "summary": "What is it about camera and the camera image that is so powerful that it keeps getting re-imagined and re-invented?\n\nSascha Pohflepp's \"Blind Camera\" project from 2006 is a brilliant exploration of this question, and its relevance is more pronounced than ever in today's AI-driven world, particularly in the context of image generation and manipulation. \n\nNow today we have a Poetry Camera that prints poems of what it sees, and Matt Webb's Poem/1 delayed Kickstarter project that generates poems that rhyme the the time of day.\n\nThese projects, like Pohflepp's Blind Camera, are examples of ways of casting our imaginative consciousness into new terrains of possibility — and doing so in a material way that is tangible and experiential. And they are specifically expeditionary because we never expect for these to become commercial products. They are provocations, explorations, and experiments that challenge our conventional understanding of what a camera is, what a poem is, and how we relate to images and text in the world.\n\nThese are further proof points on the value of this kind of ‘Cultural R&D’ and an argument for installing expeditionary teams like this within the companies that are driving AI forward. The 17+ years of experience I have had creating software and hardware products with this kind of expeditionary consciousness has led me to believe that this kind of work — particularly at the shore of a new and vast new terrain of possibility — is essential for navigating the unknowns and opportunities that lie ahead.\n\nAre you working in this kind of exploratory space — running a lab, building prototypes, wondering what AI might mean for creativity — I’d love to exchange notes. My own work has lived for years in that overlap of imagination, prototyping, and organizational learning, and I’m always interested in what others are uncovering there.\n",

    "summary": "In this session, Hala Auf, a master’s candidate in Design for Interaction and Extended Realities at IED Barcelona, presented her thesis project exploring the agency of everyday objects through the lens of object-oriented ontology and speculative design. Her central question asks: What if vessels and objects that we overlook every day reveal a language of identity, power, and community—and in the future, not only reflect culture but actively produce it?\n\nHala proposes that objects are not neutral nouns but active verbs—agents that shape human behavior and cultural rituals. Drawing from examples such as the shared mate cup (cuia) of southern Brazil and the ubiquitous monoblock plastic chair, she frames these as “verbs” that bind or flatten human gatherings—each encoding different social grammars. The mate cup connects community and continuity; the plastic chair, by contrast, represents homogenization and convenience.\n\nHer speculative framework envisions a grammar of gatherings, where people (subjects) and objects (verbs) together form sentences that script cultural meaning. Through immersive virtual reality, Hala aims to create environments where participants can inhabit the verbs of objects—experiencing their power and symbolism rather than merely observing them. The work positions speculation as an embodied experience, inviting reflection on how designed artifacts mediate social relations and cultural futures.\n",

    "summary": "I found an old video that some students made back in the day showing the 2nd edition of the Work Kit of Design Fiction in action. It's fun, simple, and makes good use of a Lazy Susan. The overall sensibility is that there are some basic mechanics to playing with the work kit, but no rules of play. Some people need structure and rules to get going, while a small number of people can just dive in and start playing without any rules at all. My belief is that developing a muscle to contend with open-ended play is vital for bulking up one's ability to deal with ambiguity and uncertainty, vital capabilities for strategic thinking, futuring, and just contending with the complexity and vagaries of life in general.\n\nThe Work Kit was originally developed for the first TBD Catalog workshop and has gone through I think three editions, and at least one “fork” by Mateusz who made a Swedish edition. The Work Kit has been used in workshops, classes, and other settings around the world to help people get into design fiction play. It's a simple set of cards and mechanics that encourage imaginative thinking about possible futures through design.\n",

    "summary": "A conversation with Steve Fisher that gets into my personal history with futures, design, science-fiction, engineering and how all of that led to instantiating design fiction as a practice. We talk about the artifacts of imagination, how we can use design fiction to think about the future, and how we can create a more imaginative future.\nWe get into the importance of imagination as an evolutionary advantage and how we can exercise our imaginative muscles to navigate the rapidly changing world we live in. I also share some early days experiences with technology, building my first computer and why that was so important to me. It was a Xerox 820 — a popular single board computer that you could find at amateur radio fairs and the like. \nYou'd have to find a case, get a power supply, all the cables and find a monitor and disk drive (8-inch floppy drive!) to make it work. It was fun to build and finally get it to boot into CP/M..but then there was this weird thing where the “reason” for doing it would be a bit evasive until I realized much later that it was about the process and the ‘whoa cool feeling’ of imagining possibilities and circulating within a peculiar world of early homebrew computing vibes.\nThere was nothing I did with it after I got it to boot up and run except sort of imagine its possibilities. I think that was the point of it all. I think that’s what design fiction is about. It’s about imagining possibilities and creating artifacts that can help us think about the future in new ways.\n",

    "summary": "In my book ‘It's time to imagine harder’, my hypothesis was that bringing the creative consciousness back to work is a clear path to unlocking the unexpected and unanticipated, the unseen. The creative consciousness - which has a proclivity or impulse to operate comfortably even enthusiastically with the unknown — can breath in the warm oceans of ambiguity.\nThe creative consciouness ambles around in the new territories and terrains for which the old ways of knowing and being do not fit — they are not big enough to make sense of the territory. They are old. The new is new.\nThe creative consciousness is the thing that fosters the accidental discoveries, and that fosters unintended breakthroughs that challenge conventional boundaries. The creative consciousness is a catalyst for organic evolution within any effort for which uncertainty looms large.\nWhen we embrace uncertainty, we open that new terrain, providing avenues for originality that rigid idation frameworks often obscure.\nThis episode of the podcast gets into the sometimes painful but always fascinating struggle by which we try to maintain the creative spirit in an increasingly optimized world.\nWhen the denizens of efficiency and productivity are the ones who set the rules, it can feel like a losing battle to keep the spark of innovation alive. But what if we flipped the script? What if we embraced the chaos, the messiness, and the unexpected as essential ingredients for creativity?\nThe Near Future Laboratory studio is currently going through a fairly extensive renovation.\nI had to move everything out.\nEverything.\nIn the months leading up to demolition work starting, I would go back there, fully intent on getting started on packing.\nI'd have a look. Settle on a plan. And then I'd turn right on my heels and walk out, or put the unconstructed box back on the pile of 100 boxes I had ordered, and sit down at one of the desks and start working on something entirely different.\nTo some, the studio felt like a place of chaos, jumbles of ideas and possibilities emanating from scores of books, pinned-up index cards, notebooks cracked open to a page, software running on various homebrew contrivances, disassembled electronics.\nIt'd be suggested that it should be straightened up, better organized, get rid of the clutter, and so on.\nIt felt like chaos to me often enough, as well.\nBut it was a chaos that I had come to feel effervesced possibility.\nThe magic was in the choas of ideas in collision, stacked around and amongst themselves, radiating a kind of emergence of the unexpected elements joined together like a world becoming.\nIn this episode, I chat with the guys at ‘Normals,’ a creative studio that thrives on the unexpected, the illogical, and the beautifully tangentially inflected. They argue that true innovation isn’t about relentlessly pursuing efficiency, but about deliberately disrupting it – a vital conversation for anyone wrestling with the pressures of modern work.\nThis episode is a vital discussion for anyone who believes that the creative spirit is worth preserving, even in the face of relentless optimization. It’s a call to arms for those who feel that the relentless march of efficiency is stifling their creativity and and ultimately that thing we loosely call ‘innovation’ — the space where sense can be made out of chaos and confusion.\nSo have a listen as we have a coffee and chat. Come along and see how ‘Normals’ cultivates a creative environment built on embracing ambiguity, challenging assumptions, and ultimately, celebrating the power of human imagination to create something truly new.\nI hope this episode serves as a reminder that sometimes the best solutions are found not in perfectly polished plans, but in delightfully messy explorations.\nVery much like the editing of this podcast.\n",

    "summary": "The languages and apparatuses for sense-making we have today are insufficient for the territory we are entering with AI.\nWhen those who conjured AI into existence willingly express their bewilderment at the ‘how’ of the machinic contrivances they created, we are truly at the edges of a new territory; a new land where ways of being and ways of knowing feel different.\nOur existing notions of self, purpose, value, ways of knowing and ways of being are insufficient for the task of making sense of this new terrain. \nAI stands not as a tool, but as the entry point to this new territory. Those who probe the boundaries and edges of this new territory are the vanguard of sense-making. We need to explore, experiment and prototype our way in order to make it make sense.\nThe Artificial Intelligence Designed Fictions Research Studio is a sense-making lab, configured to help introduce new idioms, patterns, rituals, language and embodiments that help us understand a future in which AI is as normal, ordinary, and everyday as jogging and luggage with wheels.\nIt is a prototyping-based research program that explores the potential of artificial intelligence in the context of everyday life. The focus is on rapid ideation and prototyping, creating small, functional artifacts that help ground possibilities in materiality and interaction. The prototypes are designed to be playful windows into possible future opportunities, exhibiting characteristics and qualities of a possible future.\nThis Studio is relevant to you if your work addresses AI and the systemic, technical, and institutional challenges it introduces. You want your impact to scale. To do so, you must move through culture. Near Future Laboratory specializes in crafting memetic artifacts and experiential futures that make complex ideas legible, tangible, and viral. This partnership would help your ideas circulate, not just exist on paper or as talking points.\nSponsoring this Research Studio adds a new, complementary layer to the technological or policy work you already do: speculative design, narrative prototyping, and media artifacts. This gives you a memetic non-traditional comms arm that helps reach audiences not via summaries, but via symbols, feelings, and embodied scenarios.\nWe have a proven methodology for creating artifacts that resonate with people, making complex ideas accessible and engaging. Many teams and organizations employ the techniques developed here and described in our Manual of Design Fiction and other materials. These techniques are widely cited in the research literature and have been used by teams at Google, Microsoft, Meta, and many others to explore the implications of AI in their work. The artifacts we create are not just theoretical concepts, but tangible objects that can be experienced and interacted with, making them powerful tools for understanding and engaging with the future of AI.\nThe AI+DF Research Studio strengthens an ethos of prototyping, exploration, and experimentation. This ethos is absolutely essential for the vanguard we stand at. We need to explore, experiment, and prototype our way into this new territory, and the AI+DF Research Studio is a key part of that process.\n",

    "summary": "First things first: this is a ‘less yammering, more hammering’ post where I emphasize the value of speculative prototyping to augment the thinking.\nYou know..theory + practice.\nI say that because it contains a study in using AI in a creative writing context. \nI do this because, well — I can't help wonder about the possibilities of what could be and I'm convinced that the best way to explore the possibilities is to prototype and experiment with the tools at hand.\nAnd that also may mean doing some tool making, too. That is part of the prototyping. You build new tools to understand the newness of the what-could-be. Or, you know — what could become.\nNow, I deliver this caveat to you because some people are going to read this and think that I am advocating for AI to write stories. I am not. \nI am not saying that AI should write stories. \nI am not saying that AI can write stories. \nI am not saying that AI will write stories. \nI am saying that AI can be a tool in the creative process, a tool that can augment human creativity, a tool that can help us explore new ideas and possibilities.\nIf this makes you angry or fearful or confused, I understand. I get it. I really do. I am not here to convince you that AI is the future of storytelling or that AI is going to replace human writers. I am here to share my experience with using AI as a tool in the creative process, and to encourage others to explore the possibilities of what could be.\nSo, take it in before you get angry, or just move along.\nI'm not trying to enshittify the world, as much as it is already.\nI'm trying to find new more habitable futures for myself and my friends.\n\nFascinating to see how these tools can ignite creative thinking, even if they don't yet deliver fully realized narratives.\nFlying back to LA today, I did a bit of an experiment using Ghostwriter’s Vibewriter mode to generate a cyberpunk story, leveraging the Llama 3.2-3b-instruct language model running locally in LM Studio. \nMy goal was simply to test some buggy code in Ghostwriter. \nI started with a generic “cyberpunk” prompt and then got into a rapid back and forth — “trading fours” sort of thing in VIBE MODE with the LLM, building on its initial prompt with a 30 second timer for my responess. \nWhile I’m not claiming this is any literary breakthrough or even good – it definitely leans towards not-so-good – I found the interactive writing experience incredibly compelling.\nThe feeling of collaborating with an AI, bouncing ideas back and forth, was genuinely intriguing. The test was actually generative in building around another project involving something called an “oraculator” – and even prompted me to ask Gemma-3-4b-it to generate a logline and film treatment cause, well — it was a long flight.\n",

I had an office room in the front of the house and a stand-up desk. It was early in the morning, probably winter as I remember there being a kind of twilight outside. In reflection, at that time, email was still a bit special and to get an email of substance from a stranger was like getting a letter in the mail from an IRL human.",

    "summary": "There are curious opportunities for using Design Fiction in branding and marketing contexts to help companies explore possible futures through speculative storytelling and prototype-driven narratives. Unlike traditional advertising, which focuses on present-day products, Design Fiction immerses audiences in “what if” scenarios that engage, challenge, and open up conversations. Brands leveraging this approach can disrupt industry norms, refine long-term strategies, and align with shifting consumer values. By embracing speculative storytelling, companies can reimagine their role in the world and position themselves as cultural pioneers.\n",

A documentation of current digital gestures,2. The making of design fiction films that speculate about their evolution “Curious Rituals” was produced as part of a research residency in the Media Design Program at Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California.\n",

    "summary": "Design Fiction creates material artifacts that serve as evidence of possible futures, originating from science fiction's concept of diegetic prototypes. Like Star Trek's Tricorder, these objects tell stories about future worlds and their values. Design Fiction finds practical applications in product design, policy development, and strategic planning.\nSpeculative Design was developed to a degree at and through the Royal College of Art's Design Interactions program, which came out of the Interaction Design program. It (Speculative Design) functions as a kind of challenge existing systems, largely to ways of being. For example, projects like United Micro Kingdoms use provocative scenarios to question technological progress and social structures. While Design Fiction works within existing systems to explore futures, Speculative Design aims to disrupt and critique them. These are rough categorizations and its important to note that there is extensive generative cross talk between these two practices and their practitioners. The debate about which and why is largely academic, and the practices themselves are often used in concert with one another. See, for example, the work here at the Near Future Laboratory, which is a mix of both practices, and often in the same project.\n",

I did this for a workshop for a group that wanted to have a world building around which they could begin to feel into a world and make strategic assessments and have a basis for meaningful conversations that were not just populated with hype and perfect outcomes.\nWhat is the value and purpose of this kind of Design Fiction artifact? Can we understand it as an augmentation of the typical analytic-minded trends and forexasting mechanisms that the business-oriented person values? What are we to do with these kinds of things given that they do not (always) lead immediately to clear decisions or solutions.\nLook at this project as a Design Fiction artifact that imagines into or from a world where artificial intelligence is mundane, woven seamlessly into the fabric of everyday life. We used this as one of the prompts/provocations leading into a two-day workshop on AI policy and strategy. Through the newspaper we explored the implications of AI futures through speculative narratives and future artifacts. This was created over the course of about two weeks leading up to the workshop itself.\nEach artifact in the newspaper (e.g. advertisements, classified ads, news articles, etc.) was created to provoke and inspire the workshop participants to think about the implications of AI futures, focusing on specific topic areas — domesticity, sports, third spaces, augmented reality, health/wellness/medicine, spirituality/belief, education, consumer culture, music, arts & entertainment, crime/malfeasance, agentic (aligned & misaligned) intelligences, work, conviviality, Each was also an extrapolation of current trends in AI and machine learning, as well as a reflection of the broader societal, ethical, and policy implications of increasingly pervasive intelligent systems.\n",

In it, we discuss the intersection of research, creativity, and practical implementation in driving innovation within organizations. There is a necessity to be explicit about the role of imagination, which I see as a kind of muscle that requires regular exercise to stay strong. Imagination is that which allows us to envision and develop new ideas, strategies, products, services, and brand evolutions. Through the lens of practical examples, such as the collaborations Near Future Laboratory has done with IKEA and the creation of innovative analog-digital devices, the our discussion gets into how imaginative thinking can lead to meaningful change. Of course 'Design Fiction' is centered as a method for organizations to forecast and strategically plan for the future, focusing on everyday, ordinary experiences as a foundation. Educating organizations and the broader community to adopt and integrate creative methodologies, helps ensure that innovation is not an accidental occurrence, but a structured and intentional process.\n",

Symbiotic, post-human, and interspecies relationships are the focus. We question the role and responsibility of humans within the ecosystem. The emphasis is on cooperation with microorganisms, cohabitation with animals and plants, or the protection of Martian inhabitants.

A prescient, groundbreaking collection of art + technology, it captures an extraordinary moment when artists, musicians, poets, and engineers were first exploring the creative potential of computers and cybernetic systems. The exhibition and catalog remind us of the remarkable and oftentimes untapped ability of technology to extend human inventiveness and creativity, probing the boundaries of possibility.\n\nA cursory review of the catalog reveals a spirit of prototyping and experimentation. Many of the projects in here (from the late 1960s!) are the kinds of things that we might see today in the context of Design Fiction, speculative design, and the kinds of art+technology practices that are now becoming more common. The catalog is a historical document, a contemporary manifesto, and a guide for the creative potential of human-machine collaboration. It is a reminder that the most interesting possibilities often lie not in having machines replicate human creativity, but in discovering entirely new forms of expression that can only emerge through the collaboration between human and machine intelligence. It is also a reminder that imagination is an existentially vital way to prototype possibility and, as such, may be considered as much a means of survival as a means of invention and innovation. Without imagination, the unexpected explorations of the unknown, and the kinds of playful experimentation that one can see in the catalog, we are left with a world that is impoverished, constrained, and lacking in the kinds of surprises that make life worth living.\n\nThe publication, edited by Jasia Reichardt, emerged from an exhibition at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts that sought to demonstrate how humans could use computers and new technology to extend their creativity and inventiveness. What makes this work particularly significant is its timing - arriving at a moment when the relationship between art and technology was still being defined, when the boundaries between human and machine creativity were first being explored in a systematic way.\n",

    "summary": "There is an evolving shift in strategic thinking. Things are moving away from rigid, top-down approaches and moving towards embracing what we might call “vivid institutional imaginaries” as the new foundation of business and innovation strategy. This shift is well-supported by research that suggests that strategy isn’t simply about predicting the future but actively constructing it through discourse and storytelling, cf Stackelberg & McDowell (2015)  Hardy and Thomas (2012).\n\nThe use of tools like Design Fiction and speculative scenarios – as demonstrated by companies utilizing “future visions” internally (Michaud, 2023) – allows organizations to explore potential outcomes, test assumptions, and even shape public perception cf Gonzatto et al., 2013.\n\nAs Glaser (1994) argued, strategic imagination is crucial for navigating uncertainty.  Furthermore, the concept of “strategy as discourse” emphasizes that narratives play a key role in establishing power dynamics and influencing organizational behavior cf Pieczka, 2018. Ultimately, this approach recognizes that the imaginary – often fueled by science fiction – isn’t merely decorative but represents a vital infrastructure for strategic action and future-oriented leadership.\n",

I share some experiences I've had in this context, including the tragic difficulty co-authors I've worked with had, to the point where the collaboration broke down as they could not do the work. It wasn't a refusal so much as a basic inability to do the mechanics necessary to promote The Manual of Design Fiction.

    "summary": "“Future Mundane” is a term coined to describe a Design Fiction approach that focuses on the normal, ordinary, everyday aspects of future scenarios. It involves exploring how emerging rituals, practices, artifacts, devices, technologies might integrate seamlessly into daily life, becoming mundane and almost invisible in their functionality; they become as normal as wheels on luggage, or televisions we talk to. Future Mundane is related to Design Fiction in the sense that both concepts involve speculative thinking about the future, but Future Mundane specifically emphasizes the subtle and unobtrusive integration of technology into everyday routines. It offers a unique perspective on how future innovations could blend seamlessly into our lives, contrasting with more dramatic or disruptive visions of the future often portrayed in traditional speculative design. By highlighting the potential for technology to become an unremarkable part of our daily experiences, Future Mundane encourages us to consider the social, cultural, and ethical implications of emerging technologies in a more nuanced and grounded way. This approach can help designers, technologists, and policymakers envision more realistic and sustainable futures that prioritize human needs and values, rather than focusing solely on technological advancement or novelty. Future Mundane is a valuable framework for exploring the implications of emerging technologies and shaping more responsible and inclusive visions of the future.",

We dive into her journey from a theater undergrad to mastering future design, where she champions participatory design with a twist. Ruth shares her passion for storytelling, not just any storytelling, but the kind that shapes our future. She's also getting busy hosting innovative workshops to help people get a sense of how design research and design fiction legible to normal humans. So buckle up, we're exploring how design, values, and a sprinkle of theater can make the world a more engaging place. Spoiler alert: there are no spoilers in here even though we talk for a moment about 'Leave the World Behind.'

Unlike science fiction, which often explores far-off possibilities, Design Fiction brings those possibilities into the present through tangible artifacts. These artifacts allow us to experience and critique potential futures, making them a powerful tool for innovation.\nBy materializing utopian visions, Design Fiction can shift the narrative from despair to hope, inspiring collective action towards sustainability. In a world inundated with regulations and frameworks, Imagination provides the vision we need to create a future worth striving for.

It does this so as to exercise the imagination, which is the existential capability we have to see/create/conjure the unexpected, unanticipated newness that we call 'inspiration' and 'innovation.' Design Fiction operates in the dynamic space between barely possible and pragmatic reality, playfully messing with the tension between the not true *yet and what could be(come). This approach ignites and inspires the kind of thinking that leads to farm-fresh ideas, while fostering the kind of engaged and thoughtful discussion that just makes one want to build something — to take action. The artifacts created through Design Fiction aren't just imagined scenarios; they function as probes and materialized experiments in the form of things like advertisements, product specifications, instructions for things yet to be manufactured. They guide us through the complexities of the grounded world and reveal how our ideals and realities might intersect in impactful, transformative ways. It is a mindset as much as a methodology.",

Drawing on examples from films like 'Jurassic Park' and '2001: A Space Odyssey,' I showed how storytelling and these diegetic prototypes help communicate complex, speculative, often futuristic concepts. I describe the cultural impact of Design Fiction on technological perception and legal precedents, particularly in relation to augmented reality and user interfaces. Practical projects such as the Quick Start Guide for a Self-Driving Car help highlight the importance of making emerging technologies accessible. Examining material culture, leaning on humor and satire is highlighted as useful ways to engage with future possibilities.\n",

    "summary": "The Overlap 09 was a weekend workshop in Pacific Grove, California where designers and business people came together to explore new ways of thinking and collaborating. The event featured storytelling, body storming, and prototype cards to inspire creativity and innovation. Participants engaged in activities that challenged traditional design approaches, fostering a space for experimentation and discovery. The workshop emphasized the importance of human connection and the role of design in shaping future possibilities.\nThis is a very lightly and perhaps poorly fashioned reposting of a blog post from 2009 that appeared on the old Near Future Laboratory blog. I am gradually moving all the old posts over here to the new blog. This one is about a workshop I attended called The Overlap. It was a great experience and I wanted to preserve the notes I made at the time.\n",

    "summary": "When Sascha Pohflepp (RIP 🫡) launched his way pre-AI pre-iPhone era project \"Blind Camera\" (née “Blinks and Buttons”) — I got just as excited as he was. His contrivance was/is a camera that doesn’t take its own photo but instead captures someone else’s. Not literally, but it borrows or copies a picture someone else took somewhere else in the world at the same moment.\n\nI also write this because the internet has gone to shit and most of the places where there was comprehensive — or even cursory — documentation of projects like this have disappeared. It's important to remember and celebrate these contributions to our cultural landscape, especially as we navigate the complexities of the digital age. As Sascha is no longer here to maintain his archive and catalog of works, I feel a responsibility to help preserve his legacy and keep the conversation alive.\n",

    "summary": "This post is about MobZombies — and is a retrospective on a project from 2007. MobZombies was an early exploration of physical electronic play, blending new electronic contrivances with the ludic character of the traditional play-ground — which in my recollection was not much more than an expansive field perhaps with a few bits of things to clamber on/over/into precariously by today's safety standards and parenting practices.This was all pre-iPhone and such and certainly well before we had sensor-packed contrivances of unimaginable computational power (from the perspective of 2007) humming in our hands. We saw into the evolution of gaming and had the fortitude and skills and vision to build it by hook or crook. And it was hook or crook.\nMobZombies, a project blending playground-style physical play with digital gaming, is now featured on Processing.org. This is like a step toward games that mix real-world activity with screen-based fun. Inspired in part by people like David Elkind on childhood development and reports on physical fitness, we were wondering about the need for games that encourage both social and physical activity. \nI'm sharing this here as I gather old posts an projects from the old Near Future Laboratory blog (which I started in 2005) and move them over to this new site. This post is from April 2007..of all things..and came up today in Office Hours when Aaron Meyers (one of the original developers of MobZombies) mentioned it. I thought it was worth sharing again.\n",

    "summary": "Prototyping the Omata One in this early instance was a way to work through some of the ideas in hardware. I had a fairly clear idea of the functional requirements, but needed to work through them in a grounded way rather than just drawing boxes and arrow on sheets of paper. \nI'd descxribe this as a macro board representing the major subsystems tha twould need to be implemented. It gave me something to point at and say, \"This is what I mean by the Omata One\", and could feed directly into the engineering specifications. It was a way to work through the engineering requirements and get a better sense of the overall system. (This all from the perspective of engineering dept.; of course there are the brand aspects and such, but first you need a thing that does what it says it does — later you can make sure the character of it as a brand is right and consistent. But, if the thing doesn't work, then the brand is irrelevant.)\n",

Each artifact in the newspaper (e.g. advertisements, classified ads, news articles, etc.) was created to provoke and inspire the workshop participants to think about the implications of AI futures. Each was also an extrapolation of current trends in AI and machine learning, as well as a reflection of the broader societal, ethical, and policy implications of increasingly pervasive intelligent systems.",

In collaboration with my friends Cezanne Charles and John Marshall of Root of Two, I organized this workshop in Detroit October 16-18 2024 at The Jam Handy venue in Detroit. We took as our brief to articulate our perspectives on the future of work by representing our informed insights, professional intutitions, and experienced imaginations in the form of something that we'd look at today as a kind of ‘Employee Manual.’",

    "summary": "MobZombies is a zombie-fleeing game where a player's movement controls an avatar in the game space. Players run away from virtual zombies by actually running.\nThis was developed while I was a Professor at USC School of Cinematic Arts, Interactive Media Division, as part of a project for the Mobile and Environmental Media class I taught in Spring 2007.\nThe game was developed by grad students (at the time) Will Carter and Aaron Meyers.\n\n\nI contributed some of the sensor hardware (like the crazy contrivances you see in the photos below) which, at the time, was very bespoke and included commercial 3-axis accelerometers and compass units which were interfaced through an Arduino board and shoved into the rendering device (sometimes a Sony portable PC running Windows, and eventually a Nokia N95) over either a serial or bluetooth connection. The game itself was a Processing application that ran tha ctual rendering and game logic.\nThe objective of the game is simple: stay alive as a horde of the undead slowly moves towards you. The longer you stay alive, the more zombies appear and the better they get at following you. The mobile aspect of the game - the player must navigate the physical world to control their avatar - makes the premise of MobZombies much more complex and difficult. Just because there are no obstacles in the virtual world of the game doesn't mean that there aren't obstacles in the real world. Imagine running away from a zombie and realizing that the only way you can continue to evade it is by somehow negotiating a brick wall in the physical space or running through the football practice field during a scrimmage.\nMobZombies is inspired by like-minded mobile games such as Botfighers or Mogi, where the player's movement in the physical world correlates to the game space. The most interesting aspect of these kind of mobile games is that they begin blurring the line between the fiction of the game world and the normal, real environment that we deal with every day. Because we carry mobile devices with us everywhere, it becomes fun to think about a version of MobZombies that kicks in at random times during the day, forcing you to stop whatever you were doing and try as hard as you can to avoid the undead.\nMobZombies, therefore is a mobile game designed not only to leverage mobility and incorporate physical movement into a gameplay experience, but also a broader move towards the increased spontaneity that mobile devices afford.\n",

I think of these experiments as a kind of \"theory object,\" artifacts designed to provoke discussions. In this case, the discussion/musing is about the interplay between first-life physical activities and second-life digital worlds.

I shared my approach of creating an Annual Report for the company, but from the future. This was all based on a robust financial model whereby I interpreted the analytic goals represented in the financial model (a very elaborate series of spreadsheets) into the form of an annual report, i.e., much more illustrative explication of the ambitions for the company, the product portfolio, etcetera.\nThis 5-day speculative design workshop explores the rapidly evolving landscape of work in an era shaped by automation, AI, biotechnology, and shifting socio-economic forces. Participants took on the roles of futurists, designers, and systems thinkers to critically reimagine what work could become—not just what trends suggest, but through radical futures that challenge assumptions and reveal deeper social, ethical, and political tensions.\nOver the course of the week, participants worked together to develop a provocative future scenario around work and create tangible artifacts from that world—ranging from policy documents to tools, platforms, or resistance movements. They'll experiment with immersive storytelling formats (films, role-play, installations) to bring these worlds to life, and use backcasting to explore how these futures might emerge from today’s conditions.\n",

    "summary": "Today I spoke at Hyper Island’s Vision Week 2025 about AI, resilience, and what it means to be human in the loop. \n\nBut the real topic was deeper: how do we preserve and strengthen imagination in a world flooded with automation?\n\nThe answer is to cultivate a mindset of curiosity and experimentation, to embrace the unknown and to see challenges as opportunities for growth. To find the ways to innovate and create value in this new landscape, we must be willing to take risks and learn from our failures — and even redefine what ‘failure’ might mean.\n\nWhat I've developed through my own practice is to look at AI as a collaboratory. A kind of co-creator or muse. I develop tools — like experiments that may or may not feel like they came from the future — that allow me to experiment with new forms of collaboration and co-creation. It's like making my own little science-fictional tools and to experiment with what AI might be like when it is a collaborator rather than something that deprives me of the kind of creativity that is uniquely and satisfyingly human.\n",

    "summary": "A podcast conversation recorded while I was at Innovation Land Summit in Bogotá Colombia. In it, we discuss the intersection of research, creativity, and practical implementation in driving innovation within organizations. There is a necessity to be explicit about the role of imagination, which I see as a kind of muscle that requires regular exercise to stay strong. Imagination is that which allows us to envision and develop new ideas, strategies, products, services, and brand evolutions. Through the lens of practical examples, such as the collaborations Near Future Laboratory has done with IKEA and the creation of innovative analog-digital devices, the our discussion gets into how imaginative thinking can lead to meaningful change. Of course 'Design Fiction' is centered as a method for organizations to forecast and strategically plan for the future, focusing on everyday, ordinary experiences as a foundation. Educating organizations and the broader community to adopt and integrate creative methodologies, helps ensure that innovation is not an accidental occurrence, but a structured and intentional process.\n",

Drawing on examples from films like 'Jurassic Park' and '2001: A Space Odyssey,' I showed how storytelling and these diegetic prototypes help communicate complex, speculative, often futuristic concepts. I describe the cultural impact of Design Fiction on technological perception and legal precedents, particularly in relation to augmented reality and user interfaces. Practical projects such as the Quick Start Guide for a Self-Driving Car help highlight the importance of making emerging technologies accessible. Examining material culture, leaning on humor and satire is highlighted as useful ways to engage with future possibilities.\n",

We are rapidly entering (and perhaps even have already entered) an era where we are able to print 3D objects at our desks, make and share laser-cut gifts for friends, and use off-the-shelf tools to plug these creations into the web and have them send status updates on our behalf. We have some commonly-held visions of the future, but what could our very wildest dreams (and nightmares) look like, beyond the cliché of the flying car? What answers can we find in speculative design? Our expert guests will explore these questions in collaboration with the audience in a hands-on, “open think-tank” format.  Addressing this contemporary issue will be Julian Bleecker: designer, researcher at the Design Strategic Projects studio at Nokia Design and co-founder of Near Future Laboratory; Alexandra Deschamps-Sonsino: product designer, entrepreneur, and partner at Really Interesting Group (London); and Anab Jain: interaction designer, founder of Superflux, and recent TED Fellow.  Following a brief talk show with Julian, Alexandra, and Anab, the audience will have the unique opportunity to collaborate with our invited experts in an “open think-tank”: a guided speculative design session wherein we’ll address the product design challenges of the near and not-so-near future.

I get into the ways Design Fiction is a kind of  prototyping that helps both speculate and materialize possible futures.

I share insights from my background in engineering and technology, and discuss my work bridging design, engineering, and science fiction. I give some illustrated accounts of how Design Fiction can be used to create artifacts from potential futures, and examples of how it can spark conversations and help teams explore possibilities beyond conventional trend analysis, policy creation, and forecasting.",

How can we imagine into the possible futures so that considered UX Design can continue to provide meaning and value? This is where Design Fiction becomes a powerful tool.

The result is a compelling revision of the dominant logic of mobile and pervasive media, emphasizing locality over ubiquity and promoting awareness of the limits of even the most fetishized new technologies.\n\nAt the risk of suggesting that, to some extent, the medium of the Wifi.Bedouin provides its own message, Bleecker's device is perhaps best understood as a cognitive tool, a means of creating conceptual and technical possibilities rather than a discrete object unto itself. The Bedouin also merges the ordinarily disparate worlds of the tinkerer-hacker-slasher with that of the academic or cultural investigator. In fact, the Wifi.Bedouin breaks no new technological ground, relying instead on several relatively common digital components that are ingeniously assembled into a self-contained, mobile package. More adventurous users are invited to try their hand at assembling a Bedouin themselves by following the step-by-step instructions in the Wifi.Bedouin DIY guide. For the less technically inclined, Vectors is soliciting project proposals for an ongoing series of field tests in order to explore the possibilities and limitations of both wireless technology and the cultural imaginary it has activated.\" – Vectors Journal Editorial Staff\n",

They also explore how cybernetics and systems thinking intersect with Black cultural practices.\n\nThe Digital Divide and Structural Inequality: The essay critiques the concept of the \"digital divide,\" suggesting that discussions often focus on access to technology without addressing deeper structural inequalities in education, economic opportunity, and representation.\n\nBlack Innovation in Cyberspace: Highlighting examples of Black technological creativity, the authors illustrate how digital tools are used for self-expression, activism, and community building.\n",

Like Star Trek's Tricorder, these objects tell stories about future worlds and their values. Design Fiction finds practical applications in product design, policy development, and strategic planning.\n  Speculative Design was developed to a degree at and through the Royal College of Art's Design Interactions program, which came out of the Interaction Design program. It (Speculative Design) functions as a kind of challenge existing systems, largely to ways of being. For example, projects like United Micro Kingdoms use provocative scenarios to question technological progress and social structures. While Design Fiction works within existing systems to explore futures, Speculative Design aims to disrupt and critique them. These are rough categorizations and its important to note that there is extensive generative cross talk between these two practices and their practitioners. The debate about which and why is largely academic, and the practices themselves are often used in concert with one another. See, for example, the work here at the Near Future Laboratory, which is a mix of both practices, and often in the same project.\n",

    "summary": "The essay challenges the conventional approach to futures thinking, arguing that certified foresight professionals, with their structured methodologies and trend analysis, miss the point of what it means to truly imagine alternative futures. Using examples like Gary Hustwit’s experimental filmmaking and Bill Bowerman’s creation of the jogging culture, the essay posits that the most impactful futures aren’t predicted; they are crafted by people asking unconventional questions and making tangible artifacts from speculative possibilities. True futurists, the essay asserts, disrupt conventional wisdom and shape new cultural paradigms—not through reports and frameworks, but by creating provocative artifacts that push us to question, engage, and rethink what the future could be.",

    "summary": "This essay examines the 1968 exhibition catalog Cybernetic Serendipity&colon; The Computer and the Arts, a landmark exploration of how emerging technologies like computers extended human creativity. Edited by Jasia Reichardt, the catalog captured the interdisciplinary spirit of collaboration among artists, engineers, and scientists, showcasing algorithmic art, computer music, and interactive installations. By emphasizing unpredictability, process, and serendipity, the catalog aligns with contemporary ideas of Design Fiction, where technology is used to imagine speculative futures rather than deterministic solutions. Drawing parallels to AI, the essay advocates for human-machine partnerships that prioritize imagination, multiplicity, and creative exploration as a blueprint for future design and engineering practices.\n",

    "summary": "In Stories to Imagine Alternate Futures, Julian Bleecker and Tobias Revell craft an engaging exploration of the intersection between storytelling and speculative design, making a compelling case for narrative as a tool to reimagine the future. The essay opens by critiquing conventional approaches to foresight, which often rely on rigid frameworks of policy and data, failing to capture the messy, emotional, and subjective nature of how humans experience potential futures. Instead, the authors champion the imaginative and disruptive power of stories, arguing that they are uniquely capable of breaking through entrenched assumptions about what lies ahead.",

    "summary": "Much like architecture, design functions as a materialization of speculative ideas, creating tangible objects that provoke reflection on how the world might be re-imagined. Through this lens, design is akin to storytelling—especially as it engages with the same speculative possibilities that science fiction does, albeit through material props rather than narrative alone. Bleecker argues that Design Fiction occupies a space between fact and fiction, exploring new social rituals and proposing innovative, non-incremental futures.\n",

They suggest an answer (or, I might hazard, at least a novel approach) to a problem that has seemed insurmountable for over a quarter century. SimCity2000™ provides the challenges inherent to running a city: the impossible task of creating a hospitable urban environment. Such is its lure; who would not want to take a crack at solving the formidable problem of urban decline?\n",

    "summary": "Start with this: an image of a Fender guitar listed for sale, featuring a colorful design and details about the item on a webpage. Buttons for purchasing options highlighting integration of cryptocurrency transactions. The setting is speculative fast-food branding, the concept of virtual collectibles, the metaverse. An e-commerce platform interface; the intersection of technology, food culture, design fiction. Themes of consumerism and digital identity in a playful yet thought-provoking manner.\nThis is what I produced during a workshop imagining into a possible future of the metaverse. Situated roughly in the year 2049, participants worked through explorations as to what the metaverse might become, how it might be used, and what cultural, social, and economic implications it might have.\nOf course, in my group, I steered the activity and outcome closer to a speculative artifact from the future, rather than a more traditional form of reporting that might be considered predictive. Working from the future backwards to the present day — and representing a possible (plausible) outcome/implication as an artifact is more my speed. In this case, the artifact I produced was a “page” from some kind of collectibles trading “platform” that transposed the vibe of collectibles, fast-food, branding and so forth imagining various evolutions (brands into platforms; restaurants as hot-seat workplaces; language/idioms morphing); etcetera as you can see if you pick through the page.\n",

We have some commonly-held visions of the future, but what could our very wildest dreams (and nightmares) look like, beyond the cliché of the flying car? What answers can we find in speculative design? Our expert guests will explore these questions in collaboration with the audience in a hands-on, “open think-tank” format.\n\nAddressing this contemporary issue will be Julian Bleecker: designer, researcher at the Design Strategic Projects studio at Nokia Design and co-founder of Near Future Laboratory; Alexandra Deschamps-Sonsino: product designer, entrepreneur, and partner at Really Interesting Group (London); and Anab Jain: interaction designer, founder of Superflux, and recent TED Fellow.\n\nFollowing a brief talk show with Julian, Alexandra, and Anab, the audience will have the unique opportunity to collaborate with our invited experts in an “open think-tank”: a guided speculative design session wherein we’ll address the product design challenges of the near and not-so-near future.\n",

The workshop explored the intersection of ubiquitous computing and gaming, discussing new designs, technologies, and business models for ubiquitous games.\nAt the time Ubicomp — Ubiquitous Computing — was an area of research and development focused on integrating computing into everyday environments and objects, making technology seamlessly available to users throughout their daily lives. This had unique resonance for me, as it became a way to use my engineering brain to think about futures — a world of connected things, environments, and experiences — in a way that was differently tangible than the typical speculative design approach, which I saw as coming more from the artist's brain. It was also a time around which Paul Dourish and Genevieve Bell's paper “Yesterday's tomorrows: notes on ubiquitous computing's dominant vision” was in circulation (pre-published, but being shared about), which Paul presented at a small informal faculty seminar group I was part of at USC..and that really inspired me to think more directly about what would become design fiction as a practice. The Ubicomp 2005 workshop on ubiquitous computing games was an important moment in this journey, bringing together researchers, designers, and industry practitioners to explore the intersection of play, networking, and pervasive media across physical-virtual experiences.\n",

A room full of artists, designers, filmmakers, and creative people sharing the work they’re making outside the brief. Sound experiments. Illegible interfaces. Broken narratives. Tools bent into new shapes. Ideas with no client, no deadline, no plan—just the need to try something no one asked for. A rare glimpse into experimental ventures headed straight into unknown territory.\n\n​Sideshow is a space for work that’s personal, unruly, and unfinished—kept alive in spite of economic pressure and the pull of everything more urgent.  It’s a chance to share what’s taking shape, spark something new, and help each other keep going. Not by scaling up. Just by showing up. To keep alive the side that keeps us going.\n",

But the real topic was deeper: how do we preserve and strengthen imagination in a world flooded with automation?\n\nI told the Bill Bowerman story about joggers before jogging was a thing, of luggage before luggage had wheels, of futures imagined before they made sense. \n\nI didn't tell these stories to romanticize disruption, but to remind us that innovation often starts as a hunch that doesn’t quite compute. \n\nAt least not yet.\n\nThat’s what I help people and organizations do:\nTo see differently.\nTo prototype the future before it’s obvious.\nTo use AI not to replace creative thinking, but to stretch it.\n\nAI is evolving fast. Most companies feel like they're running to catch up. But maybe the edge isn’t faster adoption—it’s braver imagination.\n\nIf your team is navigating how to integrate AI in a way that aligns with your values, workflows, or culture, well — I would love to help.\n\nLet’s design not just what AI can do, but what it should do.\n",

These artifacts are designed to augment traditional, analytical approaches to future studies with imagination and sensory experiences.\n  * Design Fiction as a Tool: The value of design fiction is that it’s a method that translates ideas and scenarios about the future into tangible, visual forms. You can think of Design Fiction’s translation of research analysis into something engaging as an analog to the way a screenplay becomes an immersive, engaging visual story when it is made into a film. Design fiction serves to make future concepts more relatable and understandable.\n  * Some Examples of Artifacts I've Created\n   * Magazine from a Future with Autonomous Vehicles: Created for a client, this magazine represents a world where autonomous vehicles are commonplace. It was developed through workshops with various researchers and designers, capturing collective hopes, fears, and expectations.\n    * Book from a Future with Ho-Hum Androids: Imagine a world where androids are as common and non-threatening as a Sony Walkman. I created a book from that world —&nbsp;a pop-psychology analysis of the Android psyche.\n  * Imagination and Speculation: It’s important to imagine and speculate about different futures, considering the wide-ranging implications of technological advancements. Design Fiction presents the useful challenge to think beyond the immediate and apparent effects of new technologies.\n  * Cognitive and Sensory Engagement: Design Fiction is a way to create more immersive and sensory engagement with future scenarios, moving beyond traditional, data-driven methods. Design Fiction emphasizes the role of imagination and creativity - the making of artifacts from these futures — in making future studies more accessible and emotionally resonant.\n  ",

Please support the Near Future Laboratory Podcast and get access to our awesomely vibrant Near Future Laboratory Discord community over on Patreon.\n  \n  Here's what I covered.\n  \n  PDPal: A 20-Year Anniversary\n  I'm taking you on a trip down memory lane as I reminisce about the PDPal project, an emotional GPS I worked on 20 years ago. Discover how it made its way to the Times Square Jumbotron and how this early exploration of technology was an art-led prototyping of the kinds of location-based experiences we now take for granted from mobile devices.\n  What most resonates for me about this project, on reflection, is the critical role of imagination and imaginative art projects in driving innovation. And it occurred to me that this was as good a time as any to reflect on the two major mobile projects I've done in my career, that being PDPal and the OMATA App. Both were done on a bit of a shoestring and with fairly high personal stakes, and both are, I would say and have been told, beautiful and evocative instances of design and engineering.\n  \n  Archigram and Speculative Architecture\n  Archigram! The renowned collective of architects known for their imaginative designs in the 1960s. Consider their speculative architectural practice in contrast to today's world of Generative AI + Architecture, a topic I invite you to join me to discuss in Super Seminar 005 (https://superseminar.school)\n  \n  Patreon and Near Future Laboratory\n  I'm excited to announce our new Patreon, where you can join me and many others in the Near Future Laboratory Discord, along with our weekly office hours. We've had an incredible 190 sessions so far – that's 190 Friday's in a row, as of last week!\n  (https://patreon.com/nearfuturelaboratory)\n  \n  Chris's Employee Handbook Project\n  Chris Butler is the showrunner for this project in the Discord: creating an employee handbook as a Design Fiction archetype in order to explore possible futures of organizations.\n  \n  Book Haul\n  Check out 'The Stray Shopping Carts of Eastern North America' by Julian Montague. This book cleverly treats shopping carts as natural phenomena within our world of stuff – it's a fascinating read. Very kinda Design Fiction-y.\n  \n  Magazine from the Future of AI Project\n  I'm introducing a draft proposal for the 'AI Future Magazine' project. Our goal is to make the AI future more tangible and relatable. If you want to get involved and help create a magazine set in a future where AI is an everyday part of life, join us through Patreon!\n  ",

    "summary": "|\n  Here it is. Another episode of 'Last Week from the Near Future'. Last Week from the Near Future Laboratory - Week 48/2023\n  \n  This is what I was thinking about.\n  \n  1. Failure of Imagination: This concept is a common issue in organizations that struggle to envision anything beyond their current operations. Design Fiction can help with imagining and visualizing potential unexpected events and futures or even those that no one is able to grapple with or say out loud for fear of becoming a pariah. Design Fiction does this uniquely, behaving in a way like a court jester in some sense and thus help to avoid this pitfall.\n  \n  2. AI Futures in Everyday Life: It is important that we imagine AI's impact on ordinary, everyday aspects of life, such as breakfast routines or sports, rather than just focusing on extreme dystopian or utopian scenarios.\n  \n  3. Material Cultural Artifacts: Creating tangible representations of potential futures, like magazines from an imagined future, not only yield better, richer, more compelling and engaging visualizations of possible futures, the work required to create them is actual design work. Making to think and making to engage in conversations yields a richer way of 'ideating' and yields a deeper appreciation of possible outcomes.\n  \n  4. Design Fiction: A brief description of the concept of Design Fiction as a tool to bring research to life, transforming dry, prose-based research into tangible, vivid, and relatable artifacts.\n  \n  5. Importance of Vivid Representations: I try to underscore the value of creating vibrant, imaginative representations of the future, such as illustrations or fictional artifacts, to make future scenarios more relatable and understandable.\n  \n  6. Near Future Laboratory’s Approach: We here at Near Future Laboratory uses Design Fiction to create artifacts and representations that help people envision and understand potential futures.\n  \n  7. Future Seminar and Community Platform: We've got SuperSeminar (https://superseminar.school) coming up on Generative AI.\n  \n  8.

    "summary": "|\n  Episode N°005, Week Ending Nov 24, 2023Promotion of Design Fiction for AI Policy Visualization: In this Last Week from the Near Future episode, I emphasize the importance of design fiction as a tool for visualizing and materializing the potential impacts of policies like the AI Bill of Rights. I suggest that design fiction can make complex ideas more tangible and understandable for the general public.\n  \n  Analysis of the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights: I have questions about the current form of the AI Bill of Rights. If it had vivid, illustrative content it could make its implications more relatable to everyday people. I would suggest that this document, while essential, needs to be more accessible and engaging to truly resonate with its audience.\n  \n  Reference to NASA’s “Space Settlements” Report as an Inspirational Model: It's worth drawing a parallel between the AI Bill of Rights and NASA's 1973 report on space settlements. The NASA report used vivid illustrations to effectively communicate complex engineering concepts to the public, suggesting a similar approach could be beneficial for the AI Bill of Rights to make it make sense and also assert an implied policy as to what the world looks and feels like, what the experience of it would be, and what the Administration imagines this world to become should it adhere to the AI Bill of Rights.\n  \n  Need for Engaging and Accessible Communication in Technology Policy: I try to highlight the gaps that exist between complex technological policies and public understanding. I argue for the use of more engaging mediums, like design fiction, to bridge these gaps and thereby make policies more accessible and understandable.\n  \n  Call for Collaborative Effort in Translating AI Policies into Tangible Artifacts: Here's the proposal: A collaborative project to translate the AI Bill of Rights into tangible artifacts like, for example, newspapers and magazines. This approach aims to create a more concrete and relatable representation of what a future shaped by AI policies might look like.\n  \n  Thanks for watching, enduring, supporting and subscribing!\n  \n  Please support this work over on Patreon:https://patreon.com/nearfuturelaboratory or pick something up in the shop! \n  \n  https://shop.nearfuturelaboratory.com\n  \n  Blueprint for an A.I.

We suffer from too much of the same imagination.Every deck, every keynote, every speculative prototype—still echoing the same tropes: chrome cities, self-driving pods, dystopian biotech. A future flattened by repetition. Familiar. Market-tested. Boring.In episode 100 of the podcast, I caught up (again) with the gang at N O R M A L S.We found ourselves circling this question: Why do so many futures feel interchangeable? And what would it take to build ones that aren’t?Their proposal: Near future archetypes—modular, remixable worlds that aren’t just provocations but tools. Not just imagined futures, but working assets for innovation, policy, and design. Think less “trend report,” more “playable terrain.”It’s a shift from one-off spectacle to living systems. Instead of discarding scenarios each year, why not iterate them? Build them out like open-source lore. Let them gain rules, friction, culture. Let them become strange enough to surprise us.Because here’s the quiet truth: people don’t just adopt futures because they’re rationally compelling. They adopt them because they feel like home — familiar, evocative of something deeper, some feeling they have been chasing after, some vision of a world that probably goes back to the worlds they imagined when they were kids, or visions they integrated into their imagination that felt ‘cool’. So maybe the work is not only to critique the dominant tropes, but to seed alternatives that others want to live in—and then give them tools to help build those places themselves.Maybe the job isn’t just to map what comes next. Maybe it’s to make futures that feel like a place worth going.What’s one overused future trope you’d like to retire—and what would you like to imagine instead?https://normalfutu.re/nfa/nfa-essay-pt1/\n  ",

    "summary": "|\n  Visit NormalsIn my book ‘It’s time to imagine harder’, my hypothesis was that bringing the creative consciousness back to work is a clear path to unlocking the unexpected and unanticipated. A way to sense into and feel for the unseen. The creative consciousness - which has a proclivity or impulse to operate comfortably even enthusiastically with the unknown — can dream of the undreamt as if were soaking in a warm bath of ambiguity.The creative consciousness ambles around in the new territories and terrains for which the old ways of knowing and being do not fit — they are not big enough to make sense of the territory. They are The Old. The new is The New.The creative consciousness is the thing that fosters the accidental discoveries, and that fosters unintended breakthroughs that challenge conventional boundaries. The creative consciousness is a catalyst for organic evolution within any effort for which uncertainty looms large.When we embrace uncertainty, we open that new terrain, providing avenues for originality that rigid ideation frameworks often obscure.This episode of the podcast gets into the sometimes painful but always fascinating struggle by which we try to maintain the creative spirit in an increasingly optimized world.When the denizens of efficiency and productivity are the ones who set the rules, it can feel like a losing battle to keep the spark of innovation alive. But what if we flipped the script? What if we embraced the chaos, the messiness, and the unexpected as essential ingredients for creativity?In this episode, I chat with the guys at ‘Normals,’ a creative studio that thrives on the unexpected, the illogical, and the beautifully tangentially inflected. They argue that true innovation isn’t about relentlessly pursuing efficiency, but about deliberately disrupting it – a vital conversation for anyone wrestling with the pressures of modern work.This episode is a vital discussion for anyone who believes that the creative spirit is worth preserving, even in the face of relentless optimization. It’s a call to arms for those who feel that the relentless march of efficiency is stifling their creativity and and ultimately that thing we loosely call ‘innovation’ — the space where sense can be made out of chaos and confusion.So have a listen as we have a coffee and chat. Come along and see how ‘Normals’ cultivates a creative environment built on embracing ambiguity, challenging assumptions, and ultimately, celebrating the power of human imagination to create something truly new.I hope this episode serves as a reminder that sometimes the best solutions are found not in perfectly polished plans, but in delightfully messy explorations.Very much like the editing of this podcast.Oh, one last thing to say: this podcast, the newsletter, everything that goes on here is not free.

    "summary": "|\n  The Intersection of Imagination, Science Fiction, Strategy and Creativity.we wandered into something I keep circling back to: the idea that strategy is a kind of science fiction. Not in the “space battles and robots” sense, but in the deeper way that science fiction gives us permission to imagine futures—plausible or not—and then build toward them. Jarrett and I talked about design not just as a tool for solving problems, but as a mode of inquiry, a way of asking better questions and shaping new cultural narratives.We both share this instinct that branding, design, and strategy aren’t just reactive—they’re speculative. They make bets on the kind of world a product or company wants to inhabit. They tell stories about futures that don’t exist yet, and then use those stories as scaffolding for action. That’s what excites me about this work: it's not just about “making things,” it's about materializing possibilities.There's also this important undercurrent about imagination as a form of intelligence. We don’t talk enough about that. Creativity isn’t some whimsical add-on—it’s central to how organizations find direction, how they differentiate, how they respond to change. And good strategy? It needs to evoke, not just calculate.This episode was a reminder that strategy and design, at their best, operate in the realm of the imaginary. They’re speculative tools. And maybe the real work is helping people see that imagination is infrastructure.Jarrett Fuller is a designer, writer, educator, editor, and podcaster.

We talk about the ways he refers to and anticipates AI and other artifacts, of course there's a deep dive into the significance of the Minority Report's gestural interface created for the 2001 film adaptation, and how it has influenced real-world technological advancements. What prompted this discussion was the recent release of the book Towards the Realm of Materiality: Designing Philip K. Dick's Non-Existing Technologies and Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, the PKD book from an \"adjacent now.\"The question I have is this: what methods can be adopted in order to operationalize these science fiction themes into practical realities, with the aim of constructing a more habitable world using advanced design and speculative concepts.Please consider supporting the podcast and joining the Near Future Laboratory community over on Patreon!Exploring AI Imaginaries and Future Speculations\n  \n  In this episode, we discuss the continuation of the AI magazine project and the upcoming season of the Super Seminar series.

Dick's works, particularly focusing on the adaptive nature of everyday technology. We get into the production design and cultural impact of the 2001 film \"Minority Report\", based on the 1956 (!)

Our discussion centers around the complex relationship between design, disillusionment, and the evolving role of design in society, as Silvio has articulated in his recent book 'What Design Can't Do', a critique of the rhetorical expectations placed upon design. We consider the future and past inspirations relevant to the field of Design and cover various facets of design culture, including the loss of material practices, the socio-economic impacts of design evolution, and the melancholic nostalgia among designers today. We bet into the cultural significance of memes, the backlash against crypto art, and the generational gap in the perception of technological advancements. We also get to share personal anecdotes from our professional experiences, and come to share a kind of hopeful aspiration mixed with skepticism towards the promises of modern design and technology.

They collectively imagined a future that considers and reflects upon sustainable harvesting and issues of food security. It is a public project that also served to allow IDEO to explore how Design Fiction can be brought to bear to help clients make sense of their possible futures, whether food futures or any other topic.Chesterbot 🤖 Says 👇🏽 \"confidence\": 0.9519705766608136IDEO designers Jan Rod and Kenta Kondo in Tokyo created a fictional sushi box to explore food security. They made an uncanny metal box resembling disposable supermarket packaging. Inside were sushi pieces they crafted. Details like powdered condiments provoked questions about the fictional 2027 world. Through workshops, the box aligned perspectives on food systems. It activated imagination beyond abstract concepts.\"question\": \"What was the main purpose of this conversation?\",\"answer\": \"The main purpose of this conversation was to discuss how design fiction and props like the fictional sushi box can help organizations explore potential future problems and spark imagination and alignment among diverse stakeholders. The guests spoke about their experience using a fictional sushi box prop in workshops to get participants to think about future challenges around food systems.\"\"question\": How does the topic help people imagine more thoroughly the contingencies and challenges to be faced in the future?\"answer\": The topic of using design fiction and props helps people imagine future challenges and contingencies more thoroughly in the following ways:- The fictional sushi box created a tangible artifact that participants could examine and discuss. This helped ground the speculation in a concrete object.- The highly detailed prop packaging and labels sparked participants' imaginations about how future food systems might evolve.- The familiarity of sushi helped participants project their thinking into the future starting from something they knew. - The prop provided a shared reference point for workshop participants from different backgrounds to discuss future implications.\"question\": \"What are five key take-aways from this presentation?\", \"answer\": \"Five key take-aways from this presentation are:1. Design fiction uses props and artifacts to help imagine future scenarios, not propose solutions.2. Tangible props can align stakeholders by creating a shared object to spark discussion.3.

    "summary": "|\n  This Episode is a rebroadcast of Episode 030 with Tony Dunne and Fiona Raby, preceded and amended with various explications and questions posed to the Chesterbot container of the conversation's semantics.**Speculative Design Practice** Tony Dunne and Fiona Raby's design practice has evolved over time. Initially focused on conceptual models, they now also create prototypes. They find models give more creative freedom. Their work with complex technologies like biotech led them to embrace fiction and modeling. The term 'speculative design' emerged from their critical design work engaging science and tech. They value fiction for its own sake, not just for discussing the future or selling concepts. **Teaching Speculative Design** Dunne and Raby direct the Design Reality Studio at Parsons, teaching posthumanism, quantum theory and designed realities. They collaborate with faculty and choose their own research. They are writing a book on new ideas and approaches in design. **Interdisciplinarity and Collaboration** Dunne, Raby and Bleecker value letting disciplines interact in surprising ways while retaining disciplinary roots. Bleecker proposes a 'general seminar' where diverse people make sense of ideas together, as Dunne and Raby have long practiced. They hope design, science, tech and industry collaborate more, though science and tech currently do so more than design. **Representing Imagined Futures** They aim to represent imagined futures expanding beyond the typical narrow range. They explore 'impossible objects' and how constraints limit collective imagination.  **Recognition and Validation** Dunne and Raby were delighted to receive the Royal Designers for Industry award, valuing its recognition of their trajectory, not just current work. They appreciate the range of practices recognized. Bleecker sees it as validating their creative practice.\n  ",

    "summary": "|\n  How does Design Fiction do the work of reporting on the future? Most futures reports are heavily analytic, styled to be read analytically and interpreted as data. Very seldom if at all is there any point of entry to create a sense of the future as something the report has come from. And this is important because the artifact itself —&nbsp;the report — provides little opportunity to experience the future as it could possibly be. This is where Design Fiction provides an opportunity for teams and organizations that are working towards a future to gain a more full spectrum sense of possible futures that can tie directly in to their day-to-day work.This is how Design Fiction has always functioned. From the seminal TBD Catalog (10th Anniversary Edition coming soon!) to IKEA Catalog and the scores of other Design Fiction projects the Near Future Laboratory has done for commercial clients over the years. Design Fiction brings the future to you, rather than simply projecting into it.In this episode Patrick Pittman and I discuss a recent client project where we created a Magazine from the Future, in this case we took our client to the autonomous vehicle future, took a look around, found a trade magazine for autonomous vehicle enthusiasts, and brought it back.

Franke was a true innovator, exploring with a pioneer's curiosity the ways humans and machines could collaborate to create unexpected work together. Before computer art was \"a thing\" and before it was at all obvious as to the processes by which one would create or collaborate with a machine, Herbert was pushing ahead. As with most innovators, it wasn't at all clear to those who had a firm grip on what could count as 'aesthetics' or 'art' that this was anything worthy of consideration. Nevertheless he continued to place value on these explorations and collaborations with everything from an oscilloscope to an Apple II and onward.Please support this podcast over at Patreon!

She taught Anthropology at Stanford before being recruited to Intel in 1998 to build out their social-science research program in their advanced R&amp;D labs. There, Bell and colleagues helped orient Intel to a more market-inspired and experience-driven approach, establishing Intel's UX competency and, indeed, introducing the viability of UX research within high technology. Together with Paul Dourish, she wrote the book 'Divining a Digital Future: Mess and Mythology in Ubiquitous Computing', an exploration of the social and cultural components of ubiquitous computing. In 2017 she returned to Australia, appointed as Entrepreneurial Fellow and distinguished professor at Australian National University's College of Engineering and Computer Science where she directs the School of Cybernetics and the Autonomy, Agency &amp; Assurance Institute.In our conversation I refer to her recent paper in the MIT Technology Review, 'The metaverse is a new word for an old idea'I mention this short documentary “You’ve Never Been Completely Honest” by Joey Izzo. (Trigger warnings apply — read the interview with Izzo before watching to figure out if you really want to watch it.)Genevieve mentions an audio recording of Gregory Bateson called \"Versailles to Cybernetics\" and a recording Stewart Brand made with Bateson and Margaret Meade that is in a kind of annotated transcript here: \"For God's Sake Margaret!\"\"Cybernetic Serendipity\" is the exhibition she mentions curated by Jasia Reichardt.Please consider supporting this podcast!

Thanks!This is a Special Bulletin from the Near Future Laboratory on a report that Michelle Kasprzak shared in our NFLPRO Discord that was commissioned and funded by by the Government of Canada, specifically Canadian Heritage. Titled \"Decrypting the Medium: A Report on the Non-Fungible Token (NFT) Marketplace\", it's a cogent, steady-handed look at the NFT Marketplace that I found insightful and refreshingly balanced. When I read it I thought it would be of general interest to the wider audience, particularly for folks who are curious enough about vanguard cultural phenomenons to not become super partisan. It's also fascinating to learn more about how the Canadian Government is educating itself as pertains NFTs and cultural production.On the heels of that report is an essay that Michelle wrote and also shared in the NFLPRO Discord titled \"Ethical Engagement with NFTs — Impossibility or Viable Aspiration\" which couples nicely with the more academic report previously mentioned.Sign up for the Near Future Laboratory Email ListMichelle KasprzakOCADUSuper Ordinary Lab\n  ",

    "summary": "|\n  Originally I wanted to have Yancey Strickler as a guest to discuss his book This Could Be Our Future: A Manifesto for a More Generous World, after I read it last spring. A year has passed since I thought it would be fun to have Yancey on and in that time he created something called Metalabel, and that was equally interesting and maybe more so because I've been actively working on various social architectures to facilitate groups and teams whose purpose is creative action, creating culture, groups and teams that translate ideas into material form. And, somehow, from what I heard and read, Metalabel sounds like it is doing something similar. So, this is what we focused on —&nbsp;futuristic kinds of arrangements of creative cultures.Because this topic is so curious and intriguing and evocative and still at the edge of making sense, I deployed a General Seminar on the topic for Wednesday April 20th at 3pm PDT, General Seminar N°20 - Metalabel WTF Join me and 16 others to work through the question and discuss this idea of the 'Metalabel.'Yancey Strickler is a writer and entrepreneur. He’s the cofounder of Kickstarter, cofounder of&nbsp;Metalabel, cofounder of the artist resource&nbsp;The Creative Independent, creator of&nbsp;Bentoism, creator of The Ideaspace, and the author of&nbsp;This Could Be Our Future: A Manifesto for a More Generous World.Please support this podcast either directly at nearfuturelaboratory.eth or over at patreon.com/nearfuturelaboratory.

Design fiction serves to make future concepts more relatable and understandable.\n  * Some Examples of Artifacts I've Created\n   * Magazine from a Future with Autonomous Vehicles: Created for a client, this magazine represents a world where autonomous vehicles are commonplace.

Please support the Near Future Laboratory Podcast and get access to our awesomely vibrant Near Future Laboratory Discord community over on Patreon.\n  \n  Here's what I covered.\n  \n  PDPal: A 20-Year Anniversary\n  I'm taking you on a trip down memory lane as I reminisce about the PDPal project, an emotional GPS I worked on 20 years ago. Discover how it made its way to the Times Square Jumbotron and how this early exploration of technology was an art-led prototyping of the kinds of location-based experiences we now take for granted from mobile devices.\n  What most resonates for me about this project, on reflection, is the critical role of imagination and imaginative art projects in driving innovation. And it occurred to me that this was as good a time as any to reflect on the two major mobile projects I've done in my career, that being PDPal and the OMATA App. Both were done on a bit of a shoestring and with fairly high personal stakes, and both are, I would say and have been told, beautiful and evocative instances of design and engineering.\n  \n  Archigram and Speculative Architecture\n  Archigram! The renowned collective of architects known for their imaginative designs in the 1960s. Consider their speculative architectural practice in contrast to today's world of Generative AI + Architecture, a topic I invite you to join me to discuss in Super Seminar 005 (https://superseminar.school)\n  \n  Patreon and Near Future Laboratory\n  I'm excited to announce our new Patreon, where you can join me and many others in the Near Future Laboratory Discord, along with our weekly office hours. We've had an incredible 190 sessions so far – that's 190 Friday's in a row, as of last week!\n  (https://patreon.com/nearfuturelaboratory)\n  \n  Chris's Employee Handbook Project\n  Chris Butler is the showrunner for this project in the Discord: creating an employee handbook as a Design Fiction archetype in order to explore possible futures of organizations.\n  \n  Book Haul\n  Check out 'The Stray Shopping Carts of Eastern North America' by Julian Montague. This book cleverly treats shopping carts as natural phenomena within our world of stuff – it's a fascinating read. Very kinda Design Fiction-y.\n  \n  Magazine from the Future of AI Project\n  I'm introducing a draft proposal for the 'AI Future Magazine' project. Our goal is to make the AI future more tangible and relatable.

    "summary": "|\n  Here it is. Another episode of 'Last Week from the Near Future'. Last Week from the Near Future Laboratory - Week 48/2023\n  \n  This is what I was thinking about.\n  \n  1. Failure of Imagination: This concept is a common issue in organizations that struggle to envision anything beyond their current operations. Design Fiction can help with imagining and visualizing potential unexpected events and futures or even those that no one is able to grapple with or say out loud for fear of becoming a pariah. Design Fiction does this uniquely, behaving in a way like a court jester in some sense and thus help to avoid this pitfall.\n  \n  2. AI Futures in Everyday Life: It is important that we imagine AI's impact on ordinary, everyday aspects of life, such as breakfast routines or sports, rather than just focusing on extreme dystopian or utopian scenarios.\n  \n  3. Material Cultural Artifacts: Creating tangible representations of potential futures, like magazines from an imagined future, not only yield better, richer, more compelling and engaging visualizations of possible futures, the work required to create them is actual design work. Making to think and making to engage in conversations yields a richer way of 'ideating' and yields a deeper appreciation of possible outcomes.\n  \n  4. Design Fiction: A brief description of the concept of Design Fiction as a tool to bring research to life, transforming dry, prose-based research into tangible, vivid, and relatable artifacts.\n  \n  5. Importance of Vivid Representations: I try to underscore the value of creating vibrant, imaginative representations of the future, such as illustrations or fictional artifacts, to make future scenarios more relatable and understandable.\n  \n  6. Near Future Laboratory’s Approach: We here at Near Future Laboratory uses Design Fiction to create artifacts and representations that help people envision and understand potential futures.\n  \n  7. Future Seminar and Community Platform: We've got SuperSeminar (https://superseminar.school) coming up on Generative AI.\n  \n  8.

    "summary": "|\n  Episode N°005, Week Ending Nov 24, 2023Promotion of Design Fiction for AI Policy Visualization: In this Last Week from the Near Future episode, I emphasize the importance of design fiction as a tool for visualizing and materializing the potential impacts of policies like the AI Bill of Rights. I suggest that design fiction can make complex ideas more tangible and understandable for the general public.\n  \n  Analysis of the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights: I have questions about the current form of the AI Bill of Rights. If it had vivid, illustrative content it could make its implications more relatable to everyday people. I would suggest that this document, while essential, needs to be more accessible and engaging to truly resonate with its audience.\n  \n  Reference to NASA’s “Space Settlements” Report as an Inspirational Model: It's worth drawing a parallel between the AI Bill of Rights and NASA's 1973 report on space settlements. The NASA report used vivid illustrations to effectively communicate complex engineering concepts to the public, suggesting a similar approach could be beneficial for the AI Bill of Rights to make it make sense and also assert an implied policy as to what the world looks and feels like, what the experience of it would be, and what the Administration imagines this world to become should it adhere to the AI Bill of Rights.\n  \n  Need for Engaging and Accessible Communication in Technology Policy: I try to highlight the gaps that exist between complex technological policies and public understanding. I argue for the use of more engaging mediums, like design fiction, to bridge these gaps and thereby make policies more accessible and understandable.\n  \n  Call for Collaborative Effort in Translating AI Policies into Tangible Artifacts: Here's the proposal: A collaborative project to translate the AI Bill of Rights into tangible artifacts like, for example, newspapers and magazines. This approach aims to create a more concrete and relatable representation of what a future shaped by AI policies might look like.\n  \n  Thanks for watching, enduring, supporting and subscribing!\n  \n  Please support this work over on Patreon:https://patreon.com/nearfuturelaboratory or pick something up in the shop! \n  \n  https://shop.nearfuturelaboratory.com\n  \n  Blueprint for an A.I.

What makes this work particularly significant is its timing - arriving at a moment when the relationship between art and technology was still being defined, when the boundaries between human and machine creativity were first being explored in a systematic way.\n\nRead my blog post.\n\nSee the complete catalog on archive.org.\n",

    "summary": "\nA newspaper from an AI future — a Design Fiction artifact that imagines a world where artificial intelligence is mundane, woven seamlessly into the fabric of everyday life. We used this as one of the prompts/provocations leading into a two-day workshop on AI policy and strategy. Through the newspaper we explored the implications of AI futures through speculative narratives and future artifacts.\nEach piece of content in the newspaper represents a material cultural component of the world, based on current trends as well as speculations about the multiple directionalities and implications of AI futures.\nTopics covered include AI-enabled spiritual and psychic rituals, Digital Twins (‘Digitwins’ for short in-world), AI-enabled companion species, AI-enabled emotional support intelligences (ESIs), home appliances, toys, sports as AI-backed simulations, crime ('prompt front-running’), entertainment (generative films, generative music, the future of the record 'album'), and more.\nThis was created as a speculative design fiction project, this newspaper served as a way to explore, develop, and dive deep into the implications of AI in society. It is not a means of prediction or prognostication; rather it is a way to provoke thought and discussion about the future of AI and its implications for society, governance, and policy.\nThe newspaper is a collection of articles, stories, and images that explore the future of AI in society, governance, and policy. It is a way to engage with the future in a tangible and accessible way, to spark conversations and debates about the future of AI and its implications for society, governance, and policy.\nI created the newspaper in a short, about two-week sprint to help prepare myself for a workshop, and ended up serving as a productive bit of stimulus material for the workshop itself.\nThis was a proper heads-down sprint in the studio. Alex was alongside of it as we had been having regular weekly calls, so I had good encouragement. But truth be told, I found hunkering into the work solo to be more to my general liking particularly given the too-tight self-imposed deadling to have something done in time for the London Workshop. In this case, I had to do all of the design, layout and illustrations in collaboration with various AI image makers. COming up with story/article ideas benefited from the rich interlinked world of prognosticators, industry leaders, speculators, doubters/doomers in the podcast, blog, and journalism space. This was effectively me ideating the article/story concepts based somewhat on a special gift I seem to have of an active imagination connected to my engineering and humanities sensibilities. (I keep a repository of concepts in a database as they occur to me in any case just for projects like this, or actual software/development concepts). I found that, like with TBD Catalog, imagining, extending, and extrapolating from current trends in AI happens suddenly for me. So, I wrote the articles and advertisements and just got to work grinding these out. I also did the layout and design of the newspaper, and managed the production of the physical copies. (That was a bit of a thing as I kept wanting to add concepts in the form of articles for so I'm wrestling with InDesign — which is a bear with its consistent spinning beachball even on M1 chips, SSDs and all the rest), and given the mechanics of print production, I have to add 4 pages to get one new page. So, that's generative and cool, but also..lots of action. Fortunately my printer got the job done and delivered to the venue a week before the start of the event, when really the best I could have hoped for was one day before the event. Super service.)\n\n",

    "summary": "Facing the reality of a mountain of complex problems, we will work together to create the ideal future for organizations and society. This book explores a framework for envisioning long-term future “worldviews” and methods for implementing actions within an organization to achieve these visions. It incorporates emerging design theories like Speculative Design, Designed Realities, Transition Design, Futures Literacy, and Defuturing, based on Masaki's professional experience in Japan and the US.  Envisioning a bright future is increasingly challenging with current worldviews focused on speed, quality, and cost. To address complex 21st-century issues like climate change and economic disparity, we need to reinvent our way of living and being. By “imagining” a long-term future society and backcasting from that vision, we can identify what is truly needed for today’s world.  This book emphasizes exploring “multiple possibilities” through imagination, contrasting with the traditional focus on committing to a “single solution” in education and business. It aims to inspire a diverse audience—including young people, business professionals, science fiction enthusiasts, and adventurous designers—to engage both their creative and analytical sides. Although the word “design” is in the title, no prior knowledge of design is required to read the book. (Although fluency in Japanese and ability to read Kanji are definitely required. 😉)  In the face of kinetic, chaotic, intermingled and entangled global challenges, the future requires that we #imagineharder and bring new approaches to envisioning and acting to shape the worlds we will inhabit. Masaki's book offers a framework for imagining alternative futures and creating actionable strategies, and the ways that the kinds of organizations that can bring about material change can invigorate their own collective ways of imagining in order to achieve them. Masaki draws on principles from speculative and transition design, as well as futures literacy, with the hope that these can help transcend the typical focus on short-term gains and mere operational efficiency. Masaki is encouraging a broader, more imaginative approach—one that empowers individuals and organizations to explore multiple futures and rethink what’s possible today.",

Dick, one of the most prolific and visionary authors of the 20th century, crafted compelling visions of possible futures and dystopian realities teeming with humans, artificial intelligences, and more. Yet, the Dickian universe is more than just its characters—it’s a realm intricately built with technological devices, machines, and objects entirely conceived by this brilliant mind. How did Philip K. Dick envision these technologies, and through them, the future? And now, decades after his time, how should we perceive and interpret these tools? More intriguingly, how can we decode and reconstruct the creative process that led to the creation and “materialization” of these devices? Grounded in a multidisciplinary framework, this volume explores alternative designs and projects for some of the non-existing technologies described in Philip K. Dick’s oeuvre.",

    "summary": "Mass-produced from the 1970s to the 1990s, modular kiosks like the seminal K67, designed by the Slovenian architect Saša J. Mächtig, and similar systems – including the Polish Kami, the Macedonian KC190, and the Soviet ‘Bathyscaphe’ – could be found anywhere throughout the former Eastern Bloc and ex-Yugoslav countries, from bustling city squares to socialist-era housing estates. They served as hot dog and Polish zapiekanka joints, farm egg and rotisserie chicken vendors, funeral flower shops, newsstands, car park booths, currency exchange offices, and more. Featuring over 150 kiosks – from Ljubljana to Warsaw, and from Belgrade to Berlin – this photobook provides previously unseen documentation of the remaining modernist booths that witnessed the socio-political transformation of Central and Eastern Europe at the end of the 20th century. While some remain active or have undergone refurbishment, others have been abandoned or have slowly faded from the urban landscape. The photographs in this unique collection were taken over the last decade by Zupagrafika’s founders, David Navarro and Martyna Sobecka. The book includes a foreword by urban explorer Maciej Czarnecki and an introduction by architectural historian Anna Cymer, offering invaluable insights into the history of these mobile structures.",

The text emphasizes the transition from mechanical to electronic and chemical technologies and includes artworks that highlight various aspects of machines. The exhibition and its representation in the catalog and catalog essays also examine historical attitudes towards technology, illustrating how machines have been perceived as both practical tools and sources of marvel and fantasy, and how these perceptions have evolved over time. The inclusion of functional mechanisms like automobiles and cameras serves to underscore the profound impact of technology on daily life and artistic expression.",

    "summary": "Design offers so much more than an aesthetically pleasing logo or banner, a beautification add-on after the heavy lifting. In Reimagining Design, Kevin Bethune shows how design provides a unique angle on problem-solving —how it can be leveraged strategically to cultivate innovation and anchor multidisciplinary teamwork. As he does so, he describes his journey as a Black professional through corporate America, revealing the power of transformative design, multidisciplinary leaps, and diversity.Bethune, who began as an engineer at Westinghouse, moved on to Nike (where he designed Air Jordans), and now works as a sought-after consultant on design and innovation, shows how design can transform both individual lives and organizations.In Bethune's account, diversity, equity, and inclusion emerge as a recurring theme. He shows how, as we leverage design for innovation, we also need to consider the broader ecological implications of our decisions and acknowledge the threads of systemic injustice in order to realize positive change. His book is for anyone who has felt like the \"other\" — and also for allies who want to encourage anti-racist, anti-sexist, and anti-ageist behaviors in the workplace. Design transformation takes leadership-leaders who do not act as gatekeepers but, with agility and nimbleness, build teams that mirror the marketplace. Design in harmony with other disciplines can be incredibly powerful; multidisciplinary team collaboration is the foundation of future innovation. With insight and compassion, Bethune provides a framework for bringing this about.",

    "summary": "Octavia Butler’s Xenogenesis trilogy is a compelling meditation on the existential human fear of depending on other species to survive; Beth Coleman’s Reality Was Whatever Happened: Octavia Butler AI and Other Possible Worlds relays questions of kinship, community, survival, and transformation through generative processes of image production, serialization, and fabrication.\\n Operating as an interspecies vehicle with which OBAI prompts us to reconsider race, cognition, and computability, Reality Was Whatever Happened attends to the wild edges of computational culture and politics. Contributors engage with questions of black computing, indigenous AI, relational temporalities, and the hummmm of digital repetition, while Coleman’s conversation about the process and reality of contemporary AI-driven artistic practice frames the broader ethical and aesthetic stakes of OBAI. To see beyond the current hype of AI and explore the radical potential for (de)generative reconfigurations of images, bodies, and worlds, Coleman invites readers to become complicit in and through OBAI’s project of promiscuous liberation and provocative drift.",

    "summary": "Abstract Future Studies set the broad conceptual framework within which planning can take place. They ask the question, \"Where as a society, are we going?\" In discussing such a complex question, a distinction made between \"well-structured\" problems which concentrate on perfection of means (the \"how-to-do-it\" questions) and \"ill-structured\" problems which address the question of ends (\"What ought we to do?\") some methods such as model-building, trend extrapolation, technology assessment, etc. are well suited to exploring essentially simple problems where the goal is already evident (putting a man on the moon). Other methods such as scenario-writing, morphological analysis, some kinds of Delphi studies, etc., aim to explore the possible options open to planners and the consequences of each. No clear-cut answer can be given to these more complex problems (such as poverty, crime, environmental protection, etc.); the solution chosen to deal with an ill-structured problem depends on how it is defined. Thus planning for the future must include, not only scientific and technological logical responses, but also a serious search for improving the activity of goal formulation both by planners and the public.",

    "summary": "Design is broken. Young and not-so-young designers are becoming increasingly aware of this. Many feel impotent: they were told they had the tools to make the world a better place, but instead the world takes its toll on them. Beyond a haze of hype and bold claims lies a barren land of self-doubt and impostor syndrome. Although these feels might be the Millennial norm, design culture reinforces them. In conferences we learn that \"with great power comes great responsibility\" but, when it comes to real-life clients, all they ask is to \"make the logo bigger.\"  This book probes the disillusionment that permeates design. It tackles the deskilling effects provoked by digital semi-automation, the instances of ornamental politics fashioned to please the museum-educational complex, the nebulous promises of design schools. While reviving historical expressions of disenchantment, Silvio Lorusso examines present-day memes and social media rants. To depict this disheartening crisis, he crafts a new critical vocabulary for readers to build upon. What this exposé reveals is both worrying and refreshing: rather than producing a meaningful order, design might be just about inhabiting chaos.What was once a promising field rooted in problem-solving has become a problem in itself. The skill set of designers appears shaky and insubstantial - their expertise is received with indifference, their know-how is trivialised by online services, their work is compromised by a series of unruly external factors. If you see yourself as a designer without qualities; if you feel cheated, disappointed or betrayed by design, this book is for you. Listen to Silvio discuss the book and more on Episode 089 of the Near Future Laboratory Podcast.",

    "summary": "A curious exploration of the role of design in the interplay of speculative thought, the notion of impossibility, and the design imagination, where ‘design’ isn't about solving design problems – it’s about expanding what design can be, and what can become from a reinvigorated design imagination.\nIt is classic D&R to ask one to consider the “design proposal” as prompt, not prescription, and to embrace deliberately unrealizable concepts as a way to fuel imagination. When the present moment has many feeling asthough reality itself is fractured, Not Here, Not Now makes the case for loosening the bonds of trad notions of reality if only for a moment, and take that moment to explore \"impossible objects\" as catalysts for new possibilities.\nIn a fashion, this is a much needed call to action — but not such calling for us to escape reality, nor slip our ontological moorings into an infinity of individual 'realities' of the 'you do you bro' variety.\nRather their CTA is to actively shape a more expansive reality through design – a practice fueled by questions, experiments, and a willingness to embrace the uncertain. It's a generative process, sparking investigations and explorations at the intersection of thought and everyday life.\nThrough a many coursed meal of interconnected and interlinked curiosities – drawing on philosophy, art, quantum physics – D&R invite designers to engage with a speculative “what-if,” nurturing creative ground from which yet-unknown futures might emerge. In the end, Not Here, Not Now is an optimistic call for design concerned with ideas over solutions, and a journey towards realities we can scarcely imagine.\n\nDesign can no longer be an operational task plugged into systems and organizations hellbent on efficiency and effect. It is a keyword representing our evolutionary advantage: the translation of imagination into form to make sense and make worlds.\n\n        \n\n    From the publisher\n    “What it means to design at a time when, for many people, the future seems to have become an impossibility.\n    \n    “When reality fails us, what can designers do? Question design’s relationship to reality, as Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby do, in this exhilarating, yet thoughtful, journey to the edges of science, philosophy, and literature to find new ways of thinking about the possible—and about the meaning, function, and place of design in that speculative world of “not here, not now.” A conceptual travelogue of sorts, Not Here, Not Now brings together words, images, and objects that capture, in design form, some of the ideas encountered along the way. Itself a design experiment, the richly illustrated book explores ways to bring these ideas into conversation with objects through imagined archives, libraries, glossaries, taxonomies, lists, tales, and essays.\n    \n    “The design responses in Not Here, Not Now—to a stone raft, for example, or a vegetable lamb, swatches of imaginary colors, a pocket universe in the home, objects undergoing space-time collapse—are, like the most compelling utopias, impossible by design, aiming instead to nourish the creative, intellectual, and imaginative ground from which new possibilities, still unknown, might begin to emerge.”\n\n",

    "summary": "Flowcharting From Abstractionism to Algorithmics in Art and Architecture is a 140-page book by Matthew Allen published by gta Verlag in January 2023. The book is based on Allen's Harvard University Graduate School of Design dissertation research. \\nThe book discusses how the modernist program of rationalizing creative practice between the 1930s and 1960s took a bureaucratic turn, and how decades of avant-gardist experimentation prepared the way for the computer's entry into the architectural scene. \\nIt also discusses how abstract flowcharts can be translated into concrete instructions, where things that were only hinted at in the flowchart must be worked out more precisely.\\nBy the time the computer arrived on the architectural scene, its place had been prepared by decades of avant-gardist experimentation. The modernist rationalization of creative practice took a decidedly bureaucratic turn between two generations of constructivists in the 1930s and 1960s. \\nFrom Paris to Cambridge, artists, designers and architects tried to crack the code of artistic genius to democratize the creation of better environments, thus stimulating nascent algorithmic techniques. Their motivation emerged from attempts to understand art and architecture through serial effects. By adopting flowcharting procedures from scientific mar agement, they enacted a paradigm shift that had long bee a cherished dream of modernism, replacing composition with organization as the basis of design.",

    "summary": "Artificial Intelligence—in particular the so-called \"narrow\" form of AI that has already surpassed human capabilities when it comes to specific tasks—is a ubiquitous, trusted part of our lives. But at the same time, AI is a topic that often elicits more questions than answers. Even defining \"Artificial Intelligence\" is no simple matter. In practice, AI today takes many forms, ranging from consumer-oriented primary points of interaction (AlphaGo, Alexa, Siri, etc.) to high-profile super-machines (DeepMind and Watson), to unseen scripts and bots operating behind the scenes. Few topics have both piqued such curiosity and instilled so much fear, as has been demonstrated by countless fictional and non-fictional accounts and predictions concerning AI over the last century. Perhaps only one thing is certain: if today’s narrow AI eventually develops to become Artificial General Intelligence—i.e. intelligence that meets or exceeds human level intelligence—it will impact everyone and everything in our world. \n But is artificial super intelligence\nreally inevitable? Can artificial intelligence render actual human labor obsolete—not only in in traditional manufacturing jobs, but also in knowledge industries that until now have been seen as safe from automation? When might artificial intelligence actually surpass human intelligence? And ultimately, will AI lead to human prosperity or, as some argue, human extinction?  CLOG x ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE will critically examine AI from its earliest speculations to its future...and ours.",

    "summary": "If ‘The Manual of Design Fiction’ is the How, this book is the Why. A kind of supplement to ‘The Manual’ that emphasizes that it is not just a set of techniques and approaches, but that it has a purpose, and a purpose beyond the instrumental character of any kind of process or procedure. This book is about the concept of Design Fiction and its interconnectedness to the existential capacity we have to imagine, dream, feel, and actualize possibility. It reminds us that our capacity to Imagine is our evolutionary advantage. Imagination is the way we work our way through and around the existential challenges we (have always) faced. Imagination is the ultimate strategic ’CoolTool’.\nThe book represents Design Fiction as a way of translating Imagination into a form that is legible to Structure. That is, a form of representation; a way to capture the things the creative consciousness wonders, sees, dreams in ways that Structure can comprehend and in this way is a powerful collaborative tool that puts 'creatives' in rich and meaningful conversation with 'the business.' Rather than use of conventional data formats like Excel tables and PowerPoint presentations, I argue in favor of more creative and evocative storytelling methods. Ultimately, the book aims to provoke thought and spark creativity by presenting a fictional world that challenges existing norms and invites readers to imagine the world otherwise.\nDesign Fiction can be used as a tool to rescue creativity from extractive industrial processes and protect the existential capacity of our minds to imagine, dream, feel, and actualize possibilities. By translating Imagination into the language of Structure Design Fiction allows us to play harmless, evocative, and ultimately useful pranks on the rigid systems that seek to confine our creativity. This approach creates implications rather than representations, challenging traditional ways of thinking and sparking new ideas and innovations. Through Design Fiction, we can explore alternative worlds, challenge existing norms, and push the boundaries of what is possible. It is a way to disrupt the status quo, provoke thought, and inspire change in how we perceive and interact with the world around us.\nDesign Fiction can be used as a creative approach to explore and communicate possible futures or alternative realities. Based on the ideas presented in the book, Design Fiction serves as a way to rescue creativity from industrial processes that might stifle Imagination.\nTo use Design Fiction, one would create artifacts, products, or media from an imagined world or scenario. These creations would be presented as if they were real, existing things - like the example of a fictional magazine mentioned in the book. The goal is to make these fictional designs seem plausible and familiar enough that they provoke thought and discussion about potential futures or alternate realities.\nRather than presenting ideas as dry data or analysis, Design Fiction allows for a more evocative and engaging way to explore concepts. It's described as pulling a \"harmless, evocative, effective, and ultimately useful prank on Structure.\" This means taking imaginative ideas and presenting them in a format that feels structured and legitimate, like a brand book for something entirely fictional.\nThe purpose is to translate Imagination into a form that is legible and comprehensible to more structured ways of thinking. It bridges the gap between pure creativity and the constraints of reality. By doing so, Design Fiction can potentially spark new ideas, raise important questions, or highlight implications of emerging technologies or societal changes in a tangible way.\nImportantly, Design Fiction is not just about creating fantastical visions, but about exploring plausible futures or alternatives in a way that feels grounded enough to provoke meaningful consideration. It's a tool for actualizing possibilities and imagining \"what else\" or how the world could be otherwise.\n  Design Fiction can be used as a powerful tool to challenge and disrupt existing structures and paradigms. By creating compelling, tangible artifacts from imagined futures or alternative realities, Design Fiction allows us to step outside the confines of our current thinking and envision radically different possibilities.\nOne way to use Design Fiction would be to create a fictional product, service, or experience that embodies a provocative idea or social commentary. For example, you could design a mock advertisement for a device that allows people to selectively erase memories, raising questions about the nature of identity, privacy, and the human experience. Or you could create a series of fictional news articles describing a world where artificial intelligence has taken over most jobs, sparking discussions about the future of work, income inequality, and the role of technology in society.\nAnother approach would be to use Design Fiction as a means of exploring and communicating complex or abstract concepts in a more accessible and engaging way. You could create a fictional user manual for a device that enables telepathic communication, using the familiar format of a technical document to get into ideas around language, empathy, and the nature of human connection. Or you could design a series of fictional product packaging and labels for genetically modified foods, using the visual language of branding and marketing to examine issues of bioethics, sustainability, and consumer choice.\nDesign Fiction can also be used as a tool for strategic foresight and innovation. By creating tangible artifacts from possible futures, organizations can better anticipate and prepare for a range of scenarios, identify potential opportunities and challenges, and inspire new ideas and approaches. For instance, a company could create a fictional annual report from ten years in the future, describing the successes and failures of various initiatives and strategies, as a way to stimulate long-term thinking and encourage bold, visionary planning.\n\nUltimately, the power of Design Fiction lies in its ability to make the imaginary feel real and to provoke critical reflection and dialogue about the world we live in and the world we want to create. By crafting compelling, thought-provoking artifacts that blur the lines between reality and fiction, Design Fiction can help us to challenge assumptions, explore new possibilities, and inspire transformative change. Whether used as a tool for social commentary, education, strategic planning, or simply creative expression, Design Fiction has the potential to unlock our collective imagination and help us to envision and shape a better future.",

    "summary": "Shifting between fact and fiction, between the experience of the real and our projections, fantasies, and desires, Janet Cardiff's audio-video and multimedia installations explore the complexity and vertiginous nature of subjectivity in a highly technological world. They are interactive pieces where visitors are asked to touch, listen, smell, and often move through an environment shaped both by our perceptions and by the artist's alteration of them. With references to film noir, science fiction, cyber-punk and various other filmic genres, her works, often created in collaboration with husband George Bures Miller, address the constant need to negotiate between presence and loss of self, memory and experience, sensation and imagination.",

    "summary": "We were commissioned to workshop and introduce Design Fiction as a research\nmethodology by IKEA and Stockholm University's Mobile Life Centre. We worked\nwith researchers in a practical hands-on workshop to make sense of the trends\nof the day (2015), their research areas, and possible evolutions of home life,\nconsumer trends and needs, and related topics in the categories of domestic\nlife, food, urban life, travel, leisure, and entertainment. We developed and\nrefined concepts through a focussed two-day workshop. We took these concepts,\ncontinued to evolve them and finally represent them in the form of a product\ncatalog we 'brought back' from IKEA's near future.\nRefer to the IKEA workshop page and the IKEA Catalog Project Page\n",
