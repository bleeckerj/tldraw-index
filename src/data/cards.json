    "summary": "A review I wrote of Incorporations (Zone Books, 1992), a multidisciplinary anthology exploring the intersections of technology, culture, and humanity at the close of the twentieth century. Edited by Jonathan Crary and Sanford Kwinter, the book examines how advancements in biotechnology, surveillance, and artificial intelligence have reshaped the body and societal consciousness. With contributions from fields such as philosophy, architecture, and science, essays by Judith Barry, J.G. Ballard, and Donna Haraway critique the commodification of life and the evolving relationship between humans and technology. Incorporations challenges readers to reflect on modernity’s impact and the cultural frameworks shaping the future.",

    "summary": "Organizations often ask people with a generalist, orienting sensibility to behave like delivery specialists — and then interpret the resulting friction as a personal or performance problem.\nThe essay that went out in the email newsletter last week (and appeared as well on the other various endpoints like Substack, Patreon, and LinkedIn) generated a good amount of reader mail. The questions were less about the theme of “misalignment” and more about the undergirding principles of the specialists and the generalist, and how their various approaches, ways of working, deliverables and — overall — ontologies can be distinguised and the consequences of these differences to organizations.\nNow, I recognize that these are somewhat broad schematic categories and that in practice, people are more complex and nuanced than these labels suggest. Still, I think there is value in clarifying the differences in order to better understand how they can collaborate effectively.\nSome of this comes from the confusion I had several years ago when I was asked to lead a team that is composed of very creative individuals, but who had been so thoroughly shaped by the incolcated to the operationally-oriented mindset of the larger organization within which they worked that they struggled to meet their new objectives, which were much more (very) near-term delivery oriented. I had proposed a reorientation of their remit as well as their KPIs, but I had to first clarify for myself what the differences were between these two mindsets and approaches to work. This reorientation was seen as too radical — and I felt that leading a delivery team was not the right fit for me, so I declined (after over half a year of conversations so, oh well..)\n",

As AI and culture evolve faster than process, we need teams that explore before they execute.\n\nDeveloping the experience to move from speculation to shipping is crucial. Most companies have R&D for technology, but few have R&D for culture.\n\nIt’s time to change that. By embedding a small, hands-on team focused on Cultural R&D within an organization, we can make imagination a core competency and better navigate the uncertainties of the future.\n\nWhat I've learned is how to do this.

    "summary": "What is it about camera and the camera image that is so powerful that it keeps getting re-imagined and re-invented?\n\nSascha Pohflepp's \"Blind Camera\" project from 2006 is a brilliant exploration of this question, and its relevance is more pronounced than ever in today's AI-driven world, particularly in the context of image generation and manipulation. \n\nNow today we have a Poetry Camera that prints poems of what it sees, and Matt Webb's Poem/1 delayed Kickstarter project that generates poems that rhyme the the time of day.\n\nThese projects, like Pohflepp's Blind Camera, are examples of ways of casting our imaginative consciousness into new terrains of possibility — and doing so in a material way that is tangible and experiential. And they are specifically expeditionary because we never expect for these to become commercial products. They are provocations, explorations, and experiments that challenge our conventional understanding of what a camera is, what a poem is, and how we relate to images and text in the world.\n\nThese are further proof points on the value of this kind of ‘Cultural R&D’ and an argument for installing expeditionary teams like this within the companies that are driving AI forward. The 17+ years of experience I have had creating software and hardware products with this kind of expeditionary consciousness has led me to believe that this kind of work — particularly at the shore of a new and vast new terrain of possibility — is essential for navigating the unknowns and opportunities that lie ahead.\n\nAre you working in this kind of exploratory space — running a lab, building prototypes, wondering what AI might mean for creativity — I’d love to exchange notes. My own work has lived for years in that overlap of imagination, prototyping, and organizational learning, and I’m always interested in what others are uncovering there.\n",

    "summary": "In this session, Hala Auf, a master’s candidate in Design for Interaction and Extended Realities at IED Barcelona, presented her thesis project exploring the agency of everyday objects through the lens of object-oriented ontology and speculative design. Her central question asks: What if vessels and objects that we overlook every day reveal a language of identity, power, and community—and in the future, not only reflect culture but actively produce it?\n\nHala proposes that objects are not neutral nouns but active verbs—agents that shape human behavior and cultural rituals. Drawing from examples such as the shared mate cup (cuia) of southern Brazil and the ubiquitous monoblock plastic chair, she frames these as “verbs” that bind or flatten human gatherings—each encoding different social grammars. The mate cup connects community and continuity; the plastic chair, by contrast, represents homogenization and convenience.\n\nHer speculative framework envisions a grammar of gatherings, where people (subjects) and objects (verbs) together form sentences that script cultural meaning. Through immersive virtual reality, Hala aims to create environments where participants can inhabit the verbs of objects—experiencing their power and symbolism rather than merely observing them. The work positions speculation as an embodied experience, inviting reflection on how designed artifacts mediate social relations and cultural futures.\n",

Some people need structure and rules to get going, while a small number of people can just dive in and start playing without any rules at all. My belief is that developing a muscle to contend with open-ended play is vital for bulking up one's ability to deal with ambiguity and uncertainty, vital capabilities for strategic thinking, futuring, and just contending with the complexity and vagaries of life in general.\n\nThe Work Kit was originally developed for the first TBD Catalog workshop and has gone through I think three editions, and at least one “fork” by Mateusz who made a Swedish edition. The Work Kit has been used in workshops, classes, and other settings around the world to help people get into design fiction play. It's a simple set of cards and mechanics that encourage imaginative thinking about possible futures through design.\n",

The simple beautify of translating feeling and ideas into images is a powerful way to see the world differently, to make sense of complexity, and to envision new possibilities.\nDave is a long-time friend and collaboratory. We met many years ago when he was running XPLANE, a pioneering visual thinking and visual storytelling company. He invited me to this retreat he was hosting called “The Overlap” at Asilomar Conference Center in Pacific Grove, California. It was a small gathering of about 25 or so people from various disciplines and backgrounds, all interested in design and creativity. I was the only person there who worked in technology and futures design — and probably at that time had never really been to a hands-on workshop quite like that. It was eye-opening and inspiring.\n",

It offers twelve principles such things as “do it *for* yourself” and “small is beautiful” to things like release windowing, hosting events, and making the next thing. All of this reframes marketing as care, context, and community rather than chasing metrics. It's got examples, anecdotes, and contributions from other creators (me too!), it argues for defining your own version of success, protecting your creative joy, and staying devoted to the long-term practice of making. It seems to still exist as a living/evolving Google doc.\n\nWhen I was promoting The Manual of Design Fiction, I found myself reflecting on the challenges creative people face when it comes to promoting their work. This was particularly acute when my co-authors simply could not do that kind of work. Creatives love to create (obs) and love making things but (strangely) dread the promotional side of things. This guide is Metalabel's attempt to distill what they've learned about promoting creative work in a way that feels authentic and sustainable.\n\nProduced by Metalabel, this guide is for anyone looking to promote their creative work without losing their soul. It’s a call to embrace authenticity, build meaningful connections, and find joy in the act of creation itself.\n",

The anti-aesthetic then was about resisting spectacle and surface; today it might be about reclaiming the interval of thinking and intention that generation threatens to erase. Of course, I'm not referring to all generative AI art here, but rather the kind that is produced and consumed unthinkingly, as a kind of visual fast food — all the anime, the portraits, the endless style transfers, the goof-ball “slop”, and so on that floods social media feeds, and that risks numbing our capacity to see and think critically about images.\n",

It's the ‘wheels on luggage’ effect — the ‘what took them so long..’ wondering.\nJogging wasn't a thing until, by force of commitment and fortitude, Bill Bowerman writes a book explaining it to a widespread audience.\nThe Fosbury Flop was a dramatic rethinking of the high jump that was so obvious in hindsight, but not at the time. Perhaps it was even scandalous, or I like to imagine it was. ‘Dude..don't do it!’\nI often bring this logic to the studies, experiments, and futures wonderings that I do here at Near Future Laboratory. Trying to find a kernel of something by going to the near future that responds to what notion we are missing in the present. Like with A.I. doing the work for us — some of it is great to have it do. But focussing for a moment on writing, I was wondering about the value of writing as a craft, as a thing that is not just about getting words on a page, but about the care and attention to the craft of writing itself.\n\nThis is a reflection on Tom Renner's inevitabilism post and the value of imagining alternatives to the present. How does one describe those things that will become obvious in hindsight, but do not make sense in the present? The value of imagining alternatives to the present is that it helps us see the value in things that are so obvious that we don't see them.\nThis motivates the soft gooey center of the speculative design fiction project Vibewriter, which anticipates a future where the value of writing is not in speed, but in the care and attention to the craft of writing.\n",

They did this to simulate an AI-driven environment and then observe how people react when the basic norms of familiar and mundane activities, like watching TV, are subtly disrupted.\n",

They are a design studio that creates objects and spaces that are both functional and beautiful, with a focus on sustainability and craftsmanship and the opinions of a particular feline that roams about their studio.\n\nTheir work spans various mediums, including furniture, lighting, and installations. If you look at their work, you can sense that it is driven by a playful, collaborative, and generative approach to craft and making.\n\nLike most of these conversation I get to have, its a ranging discussion.\n\nYou'll get some insights into their approach, the sorts of artifacts they create — including sculptures, furniture, and music.\n",

    "summary": "I read with interest the article in The New Yorker by Hua Hsu, \"What Happens After A.I. Destroys College Writing?\". What was most sort of..disconcerting, I suppose about the article was how flippant the students were as regards their disdain for the process of writing, and how they were using AI to generate their essays, papers, and other assignments. It was as if they were just going through the motions of college, but not really engaging with the material or the process of learning.\nBut, maybe this is their moment to define the world they will enter after college. Maybe they are just being practical, and using the tools available to them to get through the system. I don't know. But it got me thinking about the designed functional fiction projects I've been working on — particularly Ghostwriter and Vibewriter, both of which are studies, observations and reflections on what writing might become in some habitable AI future in which writing is not just done by AI, but done in collaboration with AI.\nMore like a \"Centaur\" model of writing, where the human and the AI are working together to produce something that is more than either could do alone, but the human is running or guiding the creative flow, allowing for the muse/AI to provide inspiration, prompts, and even some of the writing itself..but not all of it.\n",

    "summary": "A short response to the New Yorker article \"Can A.I. Writing Be More Than a Gimmick?\" by Anna Wiener, which explores the implications of A.I. in writing and creativity.\nReflecting on the question of A.I. and writing, I wanted to create a software artifact(s) that experimented with the idea of A.I. as a muse rather than a tool that would do the writing for me.\nI think A.I. can be a useful partner in the creative process, not taking over the writing, but acting like a mellow muse. The alternative to thinkig of writing as drudgery in the case of creative expression is to think of it more like a coach or perhaps a lowkey collaborative partner.\nOne of these software experiments/prototypes is the Vibewriter project, which is a speculative design fiction that serves as an exercise tool for writers to bulk up their brain muscles for creative writing and explore how a generative A.I. muse can be a useful partner in the creative process.\nWhen considering the role of A.I. in writing, it's essential to ask: can it truly enhance the creative process, or is it merely a tool for convenience?\nI suppose this is a bit of the motivation for the Vibewriter project, which is a speculative design fiction that is meant to be an exericse tool for writers both to get bulk up their brain muscles for creative writing and, also I suppose, to see how a generative A.I. muse can be a useful partner in the creative process.\n",

It captures not just the outcome, but the process — the late nights, the brainstorming sessions, the moments of doubt and discovery. It becomes a narrative, a story worth telling.\n\nWhile in the work I felt myself in the present and looking back on the work from the future. In the future, there was no sense of regret. I didn't want to be the guy, years down the road, queried about this chapter of life and not having a story to tell. A story I could be proud to tell, full of lessons I could share.\n\nThese books are the seeds of those stories.\n",

    "summary": "Imagine being 15 and standing at the threshold of the future, eager to understand what's ahead. That’s exactly what Vikram did after my keynote. His questions were not just about facts but about possibilities. We talked about how futures thinking isn’t just forecasting; it’s about expanding our imagination—seeing worlds that don’t yet exist. When young people like Vikram participate actively in envisioning the future, they bring fresh energy and new ideas that challenge the status quo. It’s a reminder - the future belongs to those who dare to imagine it. \n\nWe often view youth as passive consumers of information, but they are potent creators of possibility. Engaging them means more than teaching; it’s about empowering them to lead. \n\nVikram’s energy to blog is a testament to that spirit. Supporting young voices isn’t an option. Rather, it’s a necessity for a more habitable, innovative world. \n\nAre we listening enough to the next generation’s dreams and visions?\n",

    "summary": "Today I spoke at Hyper Island’s Vision Week 2025 about AI, resilience, and what it means to be human in the loop. \n\nBut the real topic was deeper: how do we preserve and strengthen imagination in a world flooded with automation?\n\nThe answer is to cultivate a mindset of curiosity and experimentation, to embrace the unknown and to see challenges as opportunities for growth. To find the ways to innovate and create value in this new landscape, we must be willing to take risks and learn from our failures — and even redefine what ‘failure’ might mean.\n\nWhat I've developed through my own practice is to look at AI as a collaboratory. A kind of co-creator or muse. I develop tools — like experiments that may or may not feel like they came from the future — that allow me to experiment with new forms of collaboration and co-creation. It's like making my own little science-fictional tools and to experiment with what AI might be like when it is a collaborator rather than something that deprives me of the kind of creativity that is uniquely and satisfyingly human.\n",

    "summary": "A conversation with Steve Fisher that gets into my personal history with futures, design, science-fiction, engineering and how all of that led to instantiating design fiction as a practice. We talk about the artifacts of imagination, how we can use design fiction to think about the future, and how we can create a more imaginative future.\nWe get into the importance of imagination as an evolutionary advantage and how we can exercise our imaginative muscles to navigate the rapidly changing world we live in. I also share some early days experiences with technology, building my first computer and why that was so important to me. It was a Xerox 820 — a popular single board computer that you could find at amateur radio fairs and the like. \nYou'd have to find a case, get a power supply, all the cables and find a monitor and disk drive (8-inch floppy drive!) to make it work. It was fun to build and finally get it to boot into CP/M..but then there was this weird thing where the “reason” for doing it would be a bit evasive until I realized much later that it was about the process and the ‘whoa cool feeling’ of imagining possibilities and circulating within a peculiar world of early homebrew computing vibes.\nThere was nothing I did with it after I got it to boot up and run except sort of imagine its possibilities. I think that was the point of it all. I think that’s what design fiction is about. It’s about imagining possibilities and creating artifacts that can help us think about the future in new ways.\n",

A bit like traditional autocomplete but entire sentences or even more can be configured.\n\nI wanted to see what this would feel like, especially with the ability to consume context from a corpus my own documents, blog posts, and other writing. The idea is that the AI can suggest completions that are relevant to my own work, which might help me to think about what I'm working on in new ways, stir my thinking in unexpected ways, and help me to translate my thoughts, musings, and ideas into prose.\n",

    "summary": "In my book ‘It's time to imagine harder’, my hypothesis was that bringing the creative consciousness back to work is a clear path to unlocking the unexpected and unanticipated, the unseen. The creative consciousness - which has a proclivity or impulse to operate comfortably even enthusiastically with the unknown — can breath in the warm oceans of ambiguity.\nThe creative consciouness ambles around in the new territories and terrains for which the old ways of knowing and being do not fit — they are not big enough to make sense of the territory. They are old. The new is new.\nThe creative consciousness is the thing that fosters the accidental discoveries, and that fosters unintended breakthroughs that challenge conventional boundaries. The creative consciousness is a catalyst for organic evolution within any effort for which uncertainty looms large.\nWhen we embrace uncertainty, we open that new terrain, providing avenues for originality that rigid idation frameworks often obscure.\nThis episode of the podcast gets into the sometimes painful but always fascinating struggle by which we try to maintain the creative spirit in an increasingly optimized world.\nWhen the denizens of efficiency and productivity are the ones who set the rules, it can feel like a losing battle to keep the spark of innovation alive. But what if we flipped the script? What if we embraced the chaos, the messiness, and the unexpected as essential ingredients for creativity?\nThe Near Future Laboratory studio is currently going through a fairly extensive renovation.\nI had to move everything out.\nEverything.\nIn the months leading up to demolition work starting, I would go back there, fully intent on getting started on packing.\nI'd have a look. Settle on a plan. And then I'd turn right on my heels and walk out, or put the unconstructed box back on the pile of 100 boxes I had ordered, and sit down at one of the desks and start working on something entirely different.\nTo some, the studio felt like a place of chaos, jumbles of ideas and possibilities emanating from scores of books, pinned-up index cards, notebooks cracked open to a page, software running on various homebrew contrivances, disassembled electronics.\nIt'd be suggested that it should be straightened up, better organized, get rid of the clutter, and so on.\nIt felt like chaos to me often enough, as well.\nBut it was a chaos that I had come to feel effervesced possibility.\nThe magic was in the choas of ideas in collision, stacked around and amongst themselves, radiating a kind of emergence of the unexpected elements joined together like a world becoming.\nIn this episode, I chat with the guys at ‘Normals,’ a creative studio that thrives on the unexpected, the illogical, and the beautifully tangentially inflected. They argue that true innovation isn’t about relentlessly pursuing efficiency, but about deliberately disrupting it – a vital conversation for anyone wrestling with the pressures of modern work.\nThis episode is a vital discussion for anyone who believes that the creative spirit is worth preserving, even in the face of relentless optimization. It’s a call to arms for those who feel that the relentless march of efficiency is stifling their creativity and and ultimately that thing we loosely call ‘innovation’ — the space where sense can be made out of chaos and confusion.\nSo have a listen as we have a coffee and chat. Come along and see how ‘Normals’ cultivates a creative environment built on embracing ambiguity, challenging assumptions, and ultimately, celebrating the power of human imagination to create something truly new.\nI hope this episode serves as a reminder that sometimes the best solutions are found not in perfectly polished plans, but in delightfully messy explorations.\nVery much like the editing of this podcast.\n",

    "summary": "The languages and apparatuses for sense-making we have today are insufficient for the territory we are entering with AI.\nWhen those who conjured AI into existence willingly express their bewilderment at the ‘how’ of the machinic contrivances they created, we are truly at the edges of a new territory; a new land where ways of being and ways of knowing feel different.\nOur existing notions of self, purpose, value, ways of knowing and ways of being are insufficient for the task of making sense of this new terrain. \nAI stands not as a tool, but as the entry point to this new territory. Those who probe the boundaries and edges of this new territory are the vanguard of sense-making. We need to explore, experiment and prototype our way in order to make it make sense.\nThe Artificial Intelligence Designed Fictions Research Studio is a sense-making lab, configured to help introduce new idioms, patterns, rituals, language and embodiments that help us understand a future in which AI is as normal, ordinary, and everyday as jogging and luggage with wheels.\nIt is a prototyping-based research program that explores the potential of artificial intelligence in the context of everyday life. The focus is on rapid ideation and prototyping, creating small, functional artifacts that help ground possibilities in materiality and interaction. The prototypes are designed to be playful windows into possible future opportunities, exhibiting characteristics and qualities of a possible future.\nThis Studio is relevant to you if your work addresses AI and the systemic, technical, and institutional challenges it introduces. You want your impact to scale. To do so, you must move through culture. Near Future Laboratory specializes in crafting memetic artifacts and experiential futures that make complex ideas legible, tangible, and viral. This partnership would help your ideas circulate, not just exist on paper or as talking points.\nSponsoring this Research Studio adds a new, complementary layer to the technological or policy work you already do: speculative design, narrative prototyping, and media artifacts. This gives you a memetic non-traditional comms arm that helps reach audiences not via summaries, but via symbols, feelings, and embodied scenarios.\nWe have a proven methodology for creating artifacts that resonate with people, making complex ideas accessible and engaging. Many teams and organizations employ the techniques developed here and described in our Manual of Design Fiction and other materials. These techniques are widely cited in the research literature and have been used by teams at Google, Microsoft, Meta, and many others to explore the implications of AI in their work. The artifacts we create are not just theoretical concepts, but tangible objects that can be experienced and interacted with, making them powerful tools for understanding and engaging with the future of AI.\nThe AI+DF Research Studio strengthens an ethos of prototyping, exploration, and experimentation. This ethos is absolutely essential for the vanguard we stand at. We need to explore, experiment, and prototype our way into this new territory, and the AI+DF Research Studio is a key part of that process.\n",

Nicolas was a gentle man in an era in which human interaction became less than gentle. He was one of my first and most consistent internet-era collaborators. I remember quite clearly where I was standing when I first received an email message from him — it was at the first house I lived in in Venice Beach. I had an office room in the front of the house and a stand-up desk. It was early in the morning, probably winter as I remember there being a kind of twilight outside. In reflection, at that time, email was still a bit special and to get an email of substance from a stranger was like getting a letter in the mail from an IRL human.",

Brands leveraging this approach can disrupt industry norms, refine long-term strategies, and align with shifting consumer values. By embracing speculative storytelling, companies can reimagine their role in the world and position themselves as cultural pioneers.\n",

    "summary": "There is an evolving shift in strategic thinking. Things are moving away from rigid, top-down approaches and moving towards embracing what we might call “vivid institutional imaginaries” as the new foundation of business and innovation strategy. This shift is well-supported by research that suggests that strategy isn’t simply about predicting the future but actively constructing it through discourse and storytelling, cf Stackelberg & McDowell (2015)  Hardy and Thomas (2012).\n\nThe use of tools like Design Fiction and speculative scenarios – as demonstrated by companies utilizing “future visions” internally (Michaud, 2023) – allows organizations to explore potential outcomes, test assumptions, and even shape public perception cf Gonzatto et al., 2013.\n\nAs Glaser (1994) argued, strategic imagination is crucial for navigating uncertainty.  Furthermore, the concept of “strategy as discourse” emphasizes that narratives play a key role in establishing power dynamics and influencing organizational behavior cf Pieczka, 2018. Ultimately, this approach recognizes that the imaginary – often fueled by science fiction – isn’t merely decorative but represents a vital infrastructure for strategic action and future-oriented leadership.\n",

That is part of the prototyping. You build new tools to understand the newness of the what-could-be. Or, you know — what could become.\nNow, I deliver this caveat to you because some people are going to read this and think that I am advocating for AI to write stories. I am not. \nI am not saying that AI should write stories. \nI am not saying that AI can write stories. \nI am not saying that AI will write stories. \nI am saying that AI can be a tool in the creative process, a tool that can augment human creativity, a tool that can help us explore new ideas and possibilities.\nIf this makes you angry or fearful or confused, I understand. I get it. I really do. I am not here to convince you that AI is the future of storytelling or that AI is going to replace human writers. I am here to share my experience with using AI as a tool in the creative process, and to encourage others to explore the possibilities of what could be.\nSo, take it in before you get angry, or just move along.\nI'm not trying to enshittify the world, as much as it is already.\nI'm trying to find new more habitable futures for myself and my friends.\n\nFascinating to see how these tools can ignite creative thinking, even if they don't yet deliver fully realized narratives.\nFlying back to LA today, I did a bit of an experiment using Ghostwriter’s Vibewriter mode to generate a cyberpunk story, leveraging the Llama 3.2-3b-instruct language model running locally in LM Studio. \nMy goal was simply to test some buggy code in Ghostwriter. \nI started with a generic “cyberpunk” prompt and then got into a rapid back and forth — “trading fours” sort of thing in VIBE MODE with the LLM, building on its initial prompt with a 30 second timer for my responess. \nWhile I’m not claiming this is any literary breakthrough or even good – it definitely leans towards not-so-good – I found the interactive writing experience incredibly compelling.\nThe feeling of collaborating with an AI, bouncing ideas back and forth, was genuinely intriguing. The test was actually generative in building around another project involving something called an “oraculator” – and even prompted me to ask Gemma-3-4b-it to generate a logline and film treatment cause, well — it was a long flight.\n",

    "summary": "Design Fiction creates material artifacts that serve as evidence of possible futures, originating from science fiction's concept of diegetic prototypes. Like Star Trek's Tricorder, these objects tell stories about future worlds and their values. Design Fiction finds practical applications in product design, policy development, and strategic planning.\nSpeculative Design was developed to a degree at and through the Royal College of Art's Design Interactions program, which came out of the Interaction Design program. It (Speculative Design) functions as a kind of challenge existing systems, largely to ways of being. For example, projects like United Micro Kingdoms use provocative scenarios to question technological progress and social structures. While Design Fiction works within existing systems to explore futures, Speculative Design aims to disrupt and critique them. These are rough categorizations and its important to note that there is extensive generative cross talk between these two practices and their practitioners. The debate about which and why is largely academic, and the practices themselves are often used in concert with one another. See, for example, the work here at the Near Future Laboratory, which is a mix of both practices, and often in the same project.\n",

    "summary": "I created this Design Fiction artifact in the form of a newspaper from a future in which AI is a normal, ordinary, and everyday aspect of our lives. I did this for a workshop for a group that wanted to have a world building around which they could begin to feel into a world and make strategic assessments and have a basis for meaningful conversations that were not just populated with hype and perfect outcomes.\nWhat is the value and purpose of this kind of Design Fiction artifact? Can we understand it as an augmentation of the typical analytic-minded trends and forexasting mechanisms that the business-oriented person values? What are we to do with these kinds of things given that they do not (always) lead immediately to clear decisions or solutions.\nLook at this project as a Design Fiction artifact that imagines into or from a world where artificial intelligence is mundane, woven seamlessly into the fabric of everyday life. We used this as one of the prompts/provocations leading into a two-day workshop on AI policy and strategy. Through the newspaper we explored the implications of AI futures through speculative narratives and future artifacts. This was created over the course of about two weeks leading up to the workshop itself.\nEach artifact in the newspaper (e.g. advertisements, classified ads, news articles, etc.) was created to provoke and inspire the workshop participants to think about the implications of AI futures, focusing on specific topic areas — domesticity, sports, third spaces, augmented reality, health/wellness/medicine, spirituality/belief, education, consumer culture, music, arts & entertainment, crime/malfeasance, agentic (aligned & misaligned) intelligences, work, conviviality, Each was also an extrapolation of current trends in AI and machine learning, as well as a reflection of the broader societal, ethical, and policy implications of increasingly pervasive intelligent systems.\n",

In it, we discuss the intersection of research, creativity, and practical implementation in driving innovation within organizations. There is a necessity to be explicit about the role of imagination, which I see as a kind of muscle that requires regular exercise to stay strong. Imagination is that which allows us to envision and develop new ideas, strategies, products, services, and brand evolutions. Through the lens of practical examples, such as the collaborations Near Future Laboratory has done with IKEA and the creation of innovative analog-digital devices, the our discussion gets into how imaginative thinking can lead to meaningful change. Of course 'Design Fiction' is centered as a method for organizations to forecast and strategically plan for the future, focusing on everyday, ordinary experiences as a foundation. Educating organizations and the broader community to adopt and integrate creative methodologies, helps ensure that innovation is not an accidental occurrence, but a structured and intentional process.\n",

The exhibition is divided into three chapters and is devoted to themes of the distant and near future. Included in these themes are proposals from the fields of art and design, which use speculative methods to make different futures visible and tangible. Symbiotic, post-human, and interspecies relationships are the focus. We question the role and responsibility of humans within the ecosystem. The emphasis is on cooperation with microorganisms, cohabitation with animals and plants, or the protection of Martian inhabitants. Visitors encounter not only post-apocalyptic futures, but also positive and desirable ones. Nevertheless, one thing is clear: human behavior must change fundamentally, and swiftly.\n",

Troy talks about how he fuses behavioral science with artistic practices like storytelling and applied improvisation. We also get into specific methods, such as using portals for easing transitions when imagining into possible futures, the kinds of warm-up activities that help foster creativity, and the importance of grounding ideas, understanding imperfections, and leveraging narrative to communicate effectively.

    "summary": "&quot;Cybernetic Serendipity&#58; The Computer and the Arts&quot; stands as a pivotal moment in the intersection of technology and creativity. A prescient, groundbreaking collection of art + technology, it captures an extraordinary moment when artists, musicians, poets, and engineers were first exploring the creative potential of computers and cybernetic systems. The exhibition and catalog remind us of the remarkable and oftentimes untapped ability of technology to extend human inventiveness and creativity, probing the boundaries of possibility.\n\nA cursory review of the catalog reveals a spirit of prototyping and experimentation. Many of the projects in here (from the late 1960s!) are the kinds of things that we might see today in the context of Design Fiction, speculative design, and the kinds of art+technology practices that are now becoming more common. The catalog is a historical document, a contemporary manifesto, and a guide for the creative potential of human-machine collaboration. It is a reminder that the most interesting possibilities often lie not in having machines replicate human creativity, but in discovering entirely new forms of expression that can only emerge through the collaboration between human and machine intelligence. It is also a reminder that imagination is an existentially vital way to prototype possibility and, as such, may be considered as much a means of survival as a means of invention and innovation. Without imagination, the unexpected explorations of the unknown, and the kinds of playful experimentation that one can see in the catalog, we are left with a world that is impoverished, constrained, and lacking in the kinds of surprises that make life worth living.\n\nThe publication, edited by Jasia Reichardt, emerged from an exhibition at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts that sought to demonstrate how humans could use computers and new technology to extend their creativity and inventiveness. What makes this work particularly significant is its timing - arriving at a moment when the relationship between art and technology was still being defined, when the boundaries between human and machine creativity were first being explored in a systematic way.\n",

    "summary": "Design Fiction is an approach and methodology that helps reveal and playfully represent possibilities in the form of pragmatic material artifacts. It does this so as to exercise the imagination, which is the existential capability we have to see/create/conjure the unexpected, unanticipated newness that we call 'inspiration' and 'innovation.' Design Fiction operates in the dynamic space between barely possible and pragmatic reality, playfully messing with the tension between the not true *yet and what could be(come). This approach ignites and inspires the kind of thinking that leads to farm-fresh ideas, while fostering the kind of engaged and thoughtful discussion that just makes one want to build something — to take action. The artifacts created through Design Fiction aren't just imagined scenarios; they function as probes and materialized experiments in the form of things like advertisements, product specifications, instructions for things yet to be manufactured. They guide us through the complexities of the grounded world and reveal how our ideals and realities might intersect in impactful, transformative ways. It is a mindset as much as a methodology.",

Kevin and I first met a zillion years ago at FOO Camp, for those who remember that and have been in touch over the years. This was a fun chat even as I had to limit myself to just four or five 'cool tools' — but I found some curious things that I've been making great use of over the last couple of years.

    "summary": "“Future Mundane” is a term coined to describe a Design Fiction approach that focuses on the normal, ordinary, everyday aspects of future scenarios. It involves exploring how emerging rituals, practices, artifacts, devices, technologies might integrate seamlessly into daily life, becoming mundane and almost invisible in their functionality; they become as normal as wheels on luggage, or televisions we talk to. Future Mundane is related to Design Fiction in the sense that both concepts involve speculative thinking about the future, but Future Mundane specifically emphasizes the subtle and unobtrusive integration of technology into everyday routines. It offers a unique perspective on how future innovations could blend seamlessly into our lives, contrasting with more dramatic or disruptive visions of the future often portrayed in traditional speculative design. By highlighting the potential for technology to become an unremarkable part of our daily experiences, Future Mundane encourages us to consider the social, cultural, and ethical implications of emerging technologies in a more nuanced and grounded way. This approach can help designers, technologists, and policymakers envision more realistic and sustainable futures that prioritize human needs and values, rather than focusing solely on technological advancement or novelty. Future Mundane is a valuable framework for exploring the implications of emerging technologies and shaping more responsible and inclusive visions of the future.",

Ruth shares her passion for storytelling, not just any storytelling, but the kind that shapes our future. She's also getting busy hosting innovative workshops to help people get a sense of how design research and design fiction legible to normal humans. So buckle up, we're exploring how design, values, and a sprinkle of theater can make the world a more engaging place.

Drawing on examples from films like 'Jurassic Park' and '2001: A Space Odyssey,' I showed how storytelling and these diegetic prototypes help communicate complex, speculative, often futuristic concepts. I describe the cultural impact of Design Fiction on technological perception and legal precedents, particularly in relation to augmented reality and user interfaces. Practical projects such as the Quick Start Guide for a Self-Driving Car help highlight the importance of making emerging technologies accessible. Examining material culture, leaning on humor and satire is highlighted as useful ways to engage with future possibilities.\n",

    "summary": "This post is about MobZombies — and is a retrospective on a project from 2007. MobZombies was an early exploration of physical electronic play, blending new electronic contrivances with the ludic character of the traditional play-ground — which in my recollection was not much more than an expansive field perhaps with a few bits of things to clamber on/over/into precariously by today's safety standards and parenting practices.This was all pre-iPhone and such and certainly well before we had sensor-packed contrivances of unimaginable computational power (from the perspective of 2007) humming in our hands. We saw into the evolution of gaming and had the fortitude and skills and vision to build it by hook or crook. And it was hook or crook.\nMobZombies, a project blending playground-style physical play with digital gaming, is now featured on Processing.org. This is like a step toward games that mix real-world activity with screen-based fun. Inspired in part by people like David Elkind on childhood development and reports on physical fitness, we were wondering about the need for games that encourage both social and physical activity. \nI'm sharing this here as I gather old posts an projects from the old Near Future Laboratory blog (which I started in 2005) and move them over to this new site. This post is from April 2007..of all things..and came up today in Office Hours when Aaron Meyers (one of the original developers of MobZombies) mentioned it. I thought it was worth sharing again.\n",

It gave me something to point at and say, \"This is what I mean by the Omata One\", and could feed directly into the engineering specifications. It was a way to work through the engineering requirements and get a better sense of the overall system. (This all from the perspective of engineering dept.; of course there are the brand aspects and such, but first you need a thing that does what it says it does — later you can make sure the character of it as a brand is right and consistent.

I made this as I was intrigued by the possibilities of generating thought-provoking and potentially preposterous concepts for products that would have to fill what would become TBD Catalog. The fun I felt about creating a generative idea generating tool was too much to ignore. It was so popular that I created 3 additional 'editions' of The Work Kit.",

It also explores future possibilities hiding just below the surface, possible phenomena such as data manipulation as a kind of doping, the impacts of high-frequency sport betting, or politics related to data-based services like media, measurement and reporting.",

In this way, design fiction may be a practice for thinking about and constructing and shaping possible near future contexts in which design-led experiences are created that are different from the canonical better-faster-cheaper visions owned by corporate futures.",

I think of these experiments as a kind of \"theory object,\" artifacts designed to provoke discussions. In this case, the discussion/musing is about the interplay between first-life physical activities and second-life digital worlds.

    "summary": "MobZombies is a zombie-fleeing game where a player's movement controls an avatar in the game space. Players run away from virtual zombies by actually running.\nThis was developed while I was a Professor at USC School of Cinematic Arts, Interactive Media Division, as part of a project for the Mobile and Environmental Media class I taught in Spring 2007.\nThe game was developed by grad students (at the time) Will Carter and Aaron Meyers.\n\n\nI contributed some of the sensor hardware (like the crazy contrivances you see in the photos below) which, at the time, was very bespoke and included commercial 3-axis accelerometers and compass units which were interfaced through an Arduino board and shoved into the rendering device (sometimes a Sony portable PC running Windows, and eventually a Nokia N95) over either a serial or bluetooth connection. The game itself was a Processing application that ran tha ctual rendering and game logic.\nThe objective of the game is simple: stay alive as a horde of the undead slowly moves towards you. The longer you stay alive, the more zombies appear and the better they get at following you. The mobile aspect of the game - the player must navigate the physical world to control their avatar - makes the premise of MobZombies much more complex and difficult. Just because there are no obstacles in the virtual world of the game doesn't mean that there aren't obstacles in the real world. Imagine running away from a zombie and realizing that the only way you can continue to evade it is by somehow negotiating a brick wall in the physical space or running through the football practice field during a scrimmage.\nMobZombies is inspired by like-minded mobile games such as Botfighers or Mogi, where the player's movement in the physical world correlates to the game space. The most interesting aspect of these kind of mobile games is that they begin blurring the line between the fiction of the game world and the normal, real environment that we deal with every day. Because we carry mobile devices with us everywhere, it becomes fun to think about a version of MobZombies that kicks in at random times during the day, forcing you to stop whatever you were doing and try as hard as you can to avoid the undead.\nMobZombies, therefore is a mobile game designed not only to leverage mobility and incorporate physical movement into a gameplay experience, but also a broader move towards the increased spontaneity that mobile devices afford.\n",

We used this as one of the prompts/provocations leading into a two-day workshop on AI policy, governance, and strategy. Through the newspaper we explored the implications of AI futures through speculative narratives and future artifacts. This was created over the course of a couple of weeks leading up to the workshop itself. Each artifact in the newspaper (e.g. advertisements, classified ads, news articles, etc.) was created to provoke and inspire the workshop participants to think about the implications of AI futures. Each was also an extrapolation of current trends in AI and machine learning, as well as a reflection of the broader societal, ethical, and policy implications of increasingly pervasive intelligent systems.",

To find the ways to innovate and create value in this new landscape, we must be willing to take risks and learn from our failures — and even redefine what ‘failure’ might mean.\n\nWhat I've developed through my own practice is to look at AI as a collaboratory. A kind of co-creator or muse. I develop tools — like experiments that may or may not feel like they came from the future — that allow me to experiment with new forms of collaboration and co-creation. It's like making my own little science-fictional tools and to experiment with what AI might be like when it is a collaborator rather than something that deprives me of the kind of creativity that is uniquely and satisfyingly human.\n",

I shared my approach of creating an Annual Report for the company, but from the future. This was all based on a robust financial model whereby I interpreted the analytic goals represented in the financial model (a very elaborate series of spreadsheets) into the form of an annual report, i.e., much more illustrative explication of the ambitions for the company, the product portfolio, etcetera.\nThis 5-day speculative design workshop explores the rapidly evolving landscape of work in an era shaped by automation, AI, biotechnology, and shifting socio-economic forces. Participants took on the roles of futurists, designers, and systems thinkers to critically reimagine what work could become—not just what trends suggest, but through radical futures that challenge assumptions and reveal deeper social, ethical, and political tensions.\nOver the course of the week, participants worked together to develop a provocative future scenario around work and create tangible artifacts from that world—ranging from policy documents to tools, platforms, or resistance movements. They'll experiment with immersive storytelling formats (films, role-play, installations) to bring these worlds to life, and use backcasting to explore how these futures might emerge from today’s conditions.\n",

Imagination is that which allows us to envision and develop new ideas, strategies, products, services, and brand evolutions. Through the lens of practical examples, such as the collaborations Near Future Laboratory has done with IKEA and the creation of innovative analog-digital devices, the our discussion gets into how imaginative thinking can lead to meaningful change. Of course 'Design Fiction' is centered as a method for organizations to forecast and strategically plan for the future, focusing on everyday, ordinary experiences as a foundation. Educating organizations and the broader community to adopt and integrate creative methodologies, helps ensure that innovation is not an accidental occurrence, but a structured and intentional process.\n",

I share insights from my background in engineering and technology, and discuss my work bridging design, engineering, and science fiction.

How can we imagine into the possible futures so that considered UX Design can continue to provide meaning and value? This is where Design Fiction becomes a powerful tool. It allows UX designers to imagine and prototype future experiences by creating artifacts that come from hypothetical futures.

Drawing on examples from films like 'Jurassic Park' and '2001: A Space Odyssey,' I showed how storytelling and these diegetic prototypes help communicate complex, speculative, often futuristic concepts. I describe the cultural impact of Design Fiction on technological perception and legal precedents, particularly in relation to augmented reality and user interfaces. Practical projects such as the Quick Start Guide for a Self-Driving Car help highlight the importance of making emerging technologies accessible. Examining material culture, leaning on humor and satire is highlighted as useful ways to engage with future possibilities.\n",

We are rapidly entering (and perhaps even have already entered) an era where we are able to print 3D objects at our desks, make and share laser-cut gifts for friends, and use off-the-shelf tools to plug these creations into the web and have them send status updates on our behalf. We have some commonly-held visions of the future, but what could our very wildest dreams (and nightmares) look like, beyond the cliché of the flying car? What answers can we find in speculative design? Our expert guests will explore these questions in collaboration with the audience in a hands-on, “open think-tank” format.  Addressing this contemporary issue will be Julian Bleecker: designer, researcher at the Design Strategic Projects studio at Nokia Design and co-founder of Near Future Laboratory; Alexandra Deschamps-Sonsino: product designer, entrepreneur, and partner at Really Interesting Group (London); and Anab Jain: interaction designer, founder of Superflux, and recent TED Fellow.  Following a brief talk show with Julian, Alexandra, and Anab, the audience will have the unique opportunity to collaborate with our invited experts in an “open think-tank”: a guided speculative design session wherein we’ll address the product design challenges of the near and not-so-near future.

    "summary": "\"Design Fiction\" is the essay I wrote in 2009 while stuck in Helsinki one very snowy weekend with not much to do except wait for Monday. What I wrote was based on a series of presentations I had given trying to represent the way that science-fiction and science fact circulated amongst each other. Over the years since the concept has been taken up in a variety of disciplines and practices, mostly focused on the ways that fiction can be integrated into practices like Design, Engineering, Strategic Foresight, Business Strategy. I came to see that Design Fiction was what could describe the way the creativity and rational practices come into meaningful and mutually beneficial collaboration.",

    "summary": "In \"Wifi.Bedouin,\" \"the concept of inserting wireless signals into unexpected places – and thereby suggesting new ways of thinking about the world – has been updated for the 21st century. The result is a compelling revision of the dominant logic of mobile and pervasive media, emphasizing locality over ubiquity and promoting awareness of the limits of even the most fetishized new technologies.\n\nAt the risk of suggesting that, to some extent, the medium of the Wifi.Bedouin provides its own message, Bleecker's device is perhaps best understood as a cognitive tool, a means of creating conceptual and technical possibilities rather than a discrete object unto itself. The Bedouin also merges the ordinarily disparate worlds of the tinkerer-hacker-slasher with that of the academic or cultural investigator. In fact, the Wifi.Bedouin breaks no new technological ground, relying instead on several relatively common digital components that are ingeniously assembled into a self-contained, mobile package. More adventurous users are invited to try their hand at assembling a Bedouin themselves by following the step-by-step instructions in the Wifi.Bedouin DIY guide. For the less technically inclined, Vectors is soliciting project proposals for an ongoing series of field tests in order to explore the possibilities and limitations of both wireless technology and the cultural imaginary it has activated.\" – Vectors Journal Editorial Staff\n",

    "summary": "A Manifesto for Networked Objects — Cohabiting with Pigeons, Arphids and Aibos in the Internet of Things,\" explores the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its implications for the interaction between humans and objects. ​ It introduces the term \"Blogjects,\" which refers to objects that blog and participate in the social web, contributing to the exchange of ideas and information. ​ The document discusses how these networked objects, or Blogjects, can track their location, maintain histories of their encounters, and assert agency by influencing social discourse and actions. ​\nThe manifesto emphasizes the transformative potential of IoT, where objects become active participants in social networks, contributing to meaningful conversations and societal changes. ​ Examples include pigeons equipped with sensors to monitor pollution levels and Aibo robots that can blog their observations. ​ The document argues that the IoT should be leveraged to create more habitable worlds by enabling objects to provide insights and perspectives on environmental, social, and political issues. ​\nThe manifesto calls for a shift in how we design and interact with networked objects, moving beyond mere connectivity to fostering deeper engagements that can lead to positive changes in the physical and social world. ​\n",

The authors argue that academic and technological discourses often focus on the theoretical potential of information technology without sufficiently acknowledging the ways in which Black communities actively engage with and shape digital spaces.\n\nKey themes of the essay include:\n\nDigital Participation and Marginalization: The essay explores how Black communities participate in cyberspace, countering narratives that frame them as merely consumers rather than active contributors to technological developments.\n\nAfro-Futurism and Cybernetics: The authors discuss Afro-futurism as a cultural and intellectual movement that imagines Black futures through technological and speculative lenses. They also explore how cybernetics and systems thinking intersect with Black cultural practices.\n\nThe Digital Divide and Structural Inequality: The essay critiques the concept of the \"digital divide,\" suggesting that discussions often focus on access to technology without addressing deeper structural inequalities in education, economic opportunity, and representation.\n\nBlack Innovation in Cyberspace: Highlighting examples of Black technological creativity, the authors illustrate how digital tools are used for self-expression, activism, and community building.\n",

    "summary": "Design Fiction creates material artifacts that serve as evidence of possible futures, originating from science fiction's concept of diegetic prototypes. Like Star Trek's Tricorder, these objects tell stories about future worlds and their values. Design Fiction finds practical applications in product design, policy development, and strategic planning.\n  Speculative Design was developed to a degree at and through the Royal College of Art's Design Interactions program, which came out of the Interaction Design program. It (Speculative Design) functions as a kind of challenge existing systems, largely to ways of being. For example, projects like United Micro Kingdoms use provocative scenarios to question technological progress and social structures. While Design Fiction works within existing systems to explore futures, Speculative Design aims to disrupt and critique them. These are rough categorizations and its important to note that there is extensive generative cross talk between these two practices and their practitioners. The debate about which and why is largely academic, and the practices themselves are often used in concert with one another. See, for example, the work here at the Near Future Laboratory, which is a mix of both practices, and often in the same project.\n",

True futurists, the essay asserts, disrupt conventional wisdom and shape new cultural paradigms—not through reports and frameworks, but by creating provocative artifacts that push us to question, engage, and rethink what the future could be.",

Edited by Jasia Reichardt, the catalog captured the interdisciplinary spirit of collaboration among artists, engineers, and scientists, showcasing algorithmic art, computer music, and interactive installations. By emphasizing unpredictability, process, and serendipity, the catalog aligns with contemporary ideas of Design Fiction, where technology is used to imagine speculative futures rather than deterministic solutions. Drawing parallels to AI, the essay advocates for human-machine partnerships that prioritize imagination, multiplicity, and creative exploration as a blueprint for future design and engineering practices.\n",

    "summary": "A review I wrote of Incorporations (Zone Books, 1992), a multidisciplinary anthology exploring the intersections of technology, culture, and humanity at the close of the twentieth century. Edited by Jonathan Crary and Sanford Kwinter, the book examines how advancements in biotechnology, surveillance, and artificial intelligence have reshaped the body and societal consciousness. With contributions from fields such as philosophy, architecture, and science, essays by Judith Barry, J.G. Ballard, and Donna Haraway critique the commodification of life and the evolving relationship between humans and technology. Incorporations challenges readers to reflect on modernity’s impact and the cultural frameworks shaping the future.",

    "summary": "SimCity2000™ is a simulation technology that allows players to build custom virtual city spaces. This game is a way to imagine utopic possibilities for urban futures; also, like the VR graphics workstation RealityEngine™, it evades the contingencies of urban racial tension to create this utopia. SimCity2000™ presents enticing and compelling alternatives to the bleak and insistent images of urban decline. They suggest an answer (or, I might hazard, at least a novel approach) to a problem that has seemed insurmountable for over a quarter century. SimCity2000™ provides the challenges inherent to running a city: the impossible task of creating a hospitable urban environment. Such is its lure; who would not want to take a crack at solving the formidable problem of urban decline?\n",

A sharp essay on utopia, dystopia, and what simulations smuggle in by leaving things out.\n\nThis perspective was my way of comprehending how technoscience (here, the simulation of the city) always-already shapes what counts as real, legible, and solvable in the world. The tools we use to make sense of the world also decide what kinds of futures we can imagine (and which ones we can’t).\n",

    "summary": "TBD Catalog stands as the first and quintessential example of a Design Fiction project. It effectively navigated a full Design Fiction process, involving a diverse group of participants from multiple fields in a futures workshop. Together, they explored emerging trends, examined their implications, and extrapolated these insights into a potential future. The outcome was a set of speculative artifacts that embodied this future in a tangible and thought-provoking form.",

    "summary": "Design Engaged 2008 was a workshop and kind of unconference held in Montreal in October 2008. The basic unconference format was to have a series of presentations on Saturday, followed by a day of field work on Sunday, and then a wrap-up on Monday. The workshop was organized by Andrew Blauvelt, Boris Muller, Mouna Karray, and Jenn Gustetic. Everyone had to present and thus this was each individual's participation in the workshop.\n\nMy presentation early sketches of what would later become my essay on  \"Design Fiction\". It explored the relationship between design, science fiction, and the material elements that help tell visual stories about the future — things like props and special effects. It was one of the first times that I shared the work for feedback and discussion — and I was grateful for the affirmation from some folks who I respected in the design world.\n\nSome respectable early figures in the digital design world were in attendance, including Nicolas Nova, Boris Anthony, Jack Schultze, Matt Jones, Timo Arnall, Raphael Grignani, Aaron Straup Cope, Molly Steenson, Younghee Jung, Russell avies, Ben Cerveny, Chris Heathcote, Eric Rodenbeck, and others whose names I can't recall at the moment.\n",

    "summary": "This was the 2005 workshop on ubiquitous computing games held in conjunction with Ubicomp 2005. The workshop explored the intersection of ubiquitous computing and gaming, discussing new designs, technologies, and business models for ubiquitous games.\nAt the time Ubicomp — Ubiquitous Computing — was an area of research and development focused on integrating computing into everyday environments and objects, making technology seamlessly available to users throughout their daily lives. This had unique resonance for me, as it became a way to use my engineering brain to think about futures — a world of connected things, environments, and experiences — in a way that was differently tangible than the typical speculative design approach, which I saw as coming more from the artist's brain. It was also a time around which Paul Dourish and Genevieve Bell's paper “Yesterday's tomorrows: notes on ubiquitous computing's dominant vision” was in circulation (pre-published, but being shared about), which Paul presented at a small informal faculty seminar group I was part of at USC..and that really inspired me to think more directly about what would become design fiction as a practice. The Ubicomp 2005 workshop on ubiquitous computing games was an important moment in this journey, bringing together researchers, designers, and industry practitioners to explore the intersection of play, networking, and pervasive media across physical-virtual experiences.\n",

    "summary": "A panel discussion and subsequent workshop on the topic of Design Fiction & Speculative Design with Anab Jain, Alexandra Deschamps-Sonsino, and Michelle Kazprzak. We are rapidly entering (and perhaps even have already entered) an era where we are able to print 3D objects at our desks, make and share laser-cut gifts for friends, and use off-the-shelf tools to plug these creations into the web and have them send status updates on our behalf. We have some commonly-held visions of the future, but what could our very wildest dreams (and nightmares) look like, beyond the cliché of the flying car? What answers can we find in speculative design? Our expert guests will explore these questions in collaboration with the audience in a hands-on, “open think-tank” format.\n\nAddressing this contemporary issue will be Julian Bleecker: designer, researcher at the Design Strategic Projects studio at Nokia Design and co-founder of Near Future Laboratory; Alexandra Deschamps-Sonsino: product designer, entrepreneur, and partner at Really Interesting Group (London); and Anab Jain: interaction designer, founder of Superflux, and recent TED Fellow.\n\nFollowing a brief talk show with Julian, Alexandra, and Anab, the audience will have the unique opportunity to collaborate with our invited experts in an “open think-tank”: a guided speculative design session wherein we’ll address the product design challenges of the near and not-so-near future.\n",
